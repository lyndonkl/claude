## Skills by Category

### 🧠 Strategic Thinking & Decision Making

**decision-matrix** - Multi-criteria decision analysis with weighted scoring, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty handling for complex choices between 3-10 options.

**bayesian-reasoning-calibration** - Probabilistic reasoning with prior/posterior updates, Bayes theorem application, and calibration techniques for reducing overconfidence.

**alignment-values-north-star** - Strategic alignment framework connecting daily decisions to core values and long-term vision using north star metrics and principle mapping.

**environmental-scanning-foresight** - Anticipate change through PESTLE analysis, weak signal detection, scenario planning (2x2 matrix), cross-impact analysis, and signposts for early warning systems.

**expected-value** - Rational decision-making under uncertainty through probability-weighted outcomes (EV = Σ p×v). Covers scenario identification, probability estimation (base rates, triangulation, calibration), payoff quantification (NPV, non-monetary factors), decision trees (fold-back induction, optionality), expected utility for risk aversion, sensitivity analysis, and bias mitigation (overconfidence, sunk costs, tail risk neglect).

**heuristics-and-checklists** - Practical decision-making through mental shortcuts (heuristics) and systematic error prevention (checklists). Design fast & frugal heuristics (recognition, take-the-best, satisficing), create effective checklists (5-9 killer items, READ-DO vs DO-CONFIRM formats), validate rules empirically (≥80% accuracy target), and mitigate cognitive biases (availability, representativeness, anchoring). Covers aviation, surgical, and software deployment checklists with proven 60-80% error reduction.

**hypotheticals-counterfactuals** - Explore alternative scenarios and test assumptions through "what if" thinking. Use counterfactual reasoning (backward-looking: "what would have happened if?") to understand causality and learn from decisions. Apply scenario planning (forward-looking: optimistic/baseline/pessimistic futures, 2×2 matrices) to prepare for uncertainty. Conduct rigorous pre-mortems (6-step process: imagine failure, identify causes, vote on risks, assign mitigations). Extract common actions, hedges, and options from scenarios. Define leading indicators with clear thresholds for monitoring which future unfolds. Covers minimal rewrite principle, causal mechanism specification, probability calibration, and stress testing decisions.

**kill-criteria-exit-ramps** - Define objective stopping rules for projects to avoid sunk cost fallacy and optimize resource allocation. Set upfront kill criteria (quantifiable metrics, time horizons, decision authority) before emotional/financial investment. Design go/no-go gates for milestone-based evaluation with increasing investment stages. Apply pivot vs. kill framework (customer pain validation, learning rate, burn rate sustainability, opportunity cost analysis). Manage project portfolios with quarterly ranking (EV/Cost ratio), systematic rebalancing, and bottom 20-30% kill threshold. Execute disciplined wind-downs (1 month max) with team reallocation, customer transition, and blameless postmortems. Use pre-mortem inversion ("would we start this today?") to overcome sunk cost bias. Normalize killing projects as capital allocation discipline. Covers behavioral economics of stopping, real options analysis, Bayesian updating for kill probability, and organizational culture change.

**portfolio-roadmapping-bets** - Strategic portfolio roadmapping across time horizons (H1/H2/H3: Now/Next/Later) with disciplined betting framework. Size bets by effort (S/M/L/XL) and impact (1x/3x/10x), sequence across horizons with dependency mapping, set exit/scale criteria for kill or double-down decisions, and balance portfolio using 70-20-10 rule (core/adjacent/transformational). Apply McKinsey Three Horizons, RICE/ICE scoring, critical path analysis, and staged funding models. Validate capacity feasibility (effort ≤ 80% capacity), ensure impact ladders to strategic theme with risk adjustment, and establish review cadence (monthly H1, quarterly H2, semi-annual H3) with kill/pivot/persevere/scale framework. Covers horizon planning, bet sizing methodologies, portfolio balancing techniques, dependency sequencing, and portfolio health metrics tracking.

**postmortem** - Blameless postmortem analysis transforming failures into learning. Document timeline with specific timestamps (detection → investigation → resolution), quantify impact across dimensions (users, revenue, SLA, reputation), conduct root cause analysis using 5 Whys or fishbone diagrams to reach systemic issues (not individual blame), define SMART corrective actions (specific, measurable, assigned, realistic, time-bound) using hierarchy of controls (eliminate, substitute, engineering controls, administrative, training). Maintain blameless tone focusing on systems/processes, conduct within 48 hours while memory fresh, track action items to >90% completion, share broadly for organizational learning. Apply to production outages, security incidents, product failures, project misses, or near-misses. Covers blameless culture principles, root cause techniques, corrective action frameworks, incident response patterns, facilitation techniques, and learning metrics.

**prioritization-effort-impact** - Transform overwhelming backlogs into actionable priorities using 2x2 effort-impact matrix (Quick Wins, Big Bets, Fill-Ins, Time Sinks). Score items on effort (1-5: time, complexity, risk, dependencies) and impact (1-5: users, business value, strategic alignment, user pain) with diverse stakeholder input (engineering estimates effort, product/sales estimate impact). Plot on matrix to identify Quick Wins (high impact, low effort - do first) vs Time Sinks (low impact, high effort - avoid). Sequence roadmap: Quick Wins first (build momentum), Big Bets second (strategic impact), Fill-Ins opportunistically, reject Time Sinks with clear rationale. Apply calibration techniques (reference examples, silent voting, forced ranking), validate with data (usage analytics, user surveys, NPS drivers), and plan capacity with 20-30% buffer. Alternative frameworks include RICE (Reach × Impact × Confidence / Effort), MoSCoW (Must/Should/Could/Won't), ICE scoring, Kano model, and cost of delay. Covers advanced scoring methodologies, stakeholder alignment techniques, roadmap optimization, dependency mapping, and common pitfalls (optimism bias, HIPPO pressure, scope creep).

**project-risk-register** - Proactively identify, assess, prioritize, and monitor project risks using structured risk register. Score risks on probability×impact (1-5 each, 5×5 matrix = 1-25 risk score) with thresholds: Critical (≥20), High (12-19), Medium (6-11), Low (1-5). For each risk: identify root cause (not symptoms), assign named owner (not "team"), define mitigation (reduce probability before) AND contingency (reduce impact if occurs), set quantifiable triggers for contingency activation. Brainstorm risks across 6 categories (technical, schedule, resource, external, scope, organizational) using structured checklists. Monitor regularly (weekly for active projects, monthly for longer) tracking new/closed risks, score changes with rationale, risk burn-down (total exposure decreasing), and leading indicators. Integrate mitigation actions into project schedule, budget contingency reserves based on Expected Monetary Value (EMV), and use Monte Carlo simulation for probabilistic forecasting (P50/P80/P95 confidence levels). Covers quantitative risk analysis (PERT estimation, sensitivity analysis, tornado diagrams), risk aggregation and correlation, advanced probability estimation (base rates, calibration training, decomposition), decision trees for sequential risks, and organizational risk maturity building.

**prototyping-pretotyping** - Test ideas cheaply before building using pretotyping (fake it: landing pages, concierge MVPs, Wizard of Oz) and prototyping (paper, clickable, coded). Choose appropriate fidelity for question: pretotype (hours, $0-100) tests demand/pricing, paper prototype (days, $0-50) tests workflow, clickable prototype (week, $500) tests UI/UX, coded prototype (month, $10K) tests feasibility, MVP (months, $100K+) tests retention. Apply fake door tests (measure clicks on "Coming Soon"), concierge MVPs (manual service before automation), Wizard of Oz (human-powered appearing automated), single-feature MVPs (one thing done well). Measure behavior over opinions: pre-commitment signals (payments strongest, then pre-orders, waitlist emails, clicks), task completion rates, error rates, retention. Set success criteria before testing (e.g., "10% conversion validates demand"), recruit real target users (n=5-10 qualitative, n=100+ quantitative), iterate quickly through fidelity ladder (start low, climb only when validated). Common pretotypes: Dropbox video (75K sign-ups before building), fake door tests, manual-first approaches. Covers experiment design principles, bias mitigation (confirmation, sampling, social desirability), statistical confidence, qualitative analysis (think-aloud protocol, thematic coding), and common failure patterns (overbuilding, no success criteria, testing wrong users, opinions over behavior).

### 💡 Problem Solving & Analysis

**decomposition-reconstruction** - Break complex problems into components, analyze independently, then reconstruct with understanding of interactions and emergent properties.

**causal-inference-root-cause** - Identify true causes vs. correlations using causal diagrams, counterfactuals, and root cause analysis (5 Whys, Ishikawa diagrams).

**abstraction-concrete-examples** - Move fluidly between abstract concepts and concrete examples to clarify thinking, test understanding, and communicate effectively.

**layered-reasoning** - Structure thinking across multiple abstraction levels (30K ft strategic → 3K ft tactical → 300 ft operational). Maintain consistency: lower layers implement upper layers, upper layers constrain lower layers. Design 3-5 layer hierarchies for system architecture, strategic planning, or cross-audience communication (CEO/manager/engineer). Validate upward consistency (ops implement tactics, tactics achieve strategy), downward consistency (strategy executable with tactics), and lateral consistency (no same-layer contradictions). Propagate changes bidirectionally (strategic shifts cascade down, operational constraints escalate up). Detect emergent properties from bottom-up patterns (Conway's Law, unintended consequences). Translate appropriately for each audience's abstraction level. Covers layer design principles, formal consistency checking, emergence recognition, abstraction gap sizing (3-10 elements per layer), and explicit layer contracts.

**negative-contrastive-framing** - Define concepts and quality criteria by showing what they're NOT—use anti-goals, near-miss examples, and failure patterns to clarify fuzzy boundaries where positive definitions alone are ambiguous. Generate 3-5 anti-goals (true opposites), 5-10 instructive near-misses (examples that almost pass but fail on single dimension), and common failure patterns with detection heuristics and prevention guards. Create contrast matrices varying dimensions systematically to explore boundary space (clear pass, borderline pass, borderline fail, clear fail). Operationalize fuzzy criteria into testable decision rules through contrast insights. Apply boundary mapping to find exact pass/fail thresholds for continuous dimensions. Build failure taxonomies (by severity, type, detection difficulty) with root cause analysis and prevention strategies. Use for teaching by counterexample (revealing misconceptions through near-misses), setting design guardrails (code quality anti-patterns, UX violations), defining evaluation criteria (what disqualifies candidates), preventing common mistakes (QA checklists), and requirements clarification (disambiguating similar concepts). Covers engineering (maintainable code, test quality), design (intuitive interfaces, accessibility), communication (clear writing, audience fit), and strategy (market positioning, brand identity). Near-misses are most valuable when genuinely close calls that isolate single failing dimension.

Resolve technical contradictions (improve parameter A worsens parameter B) using 40 inventive principles and contradiction matrix: common trade-offs include speed vs precision, strength vs weight, cost vs quality, capacity vs size. Apply principles through creative adaptation (segmentation, taking out, nesting, asymmetry, dynamics, feedback, intermediary, self-service). Covers trends of technical evolution (mono-bi-poly, micro-level transition, increasing dynamism), substance-field analysis for modeling interactions, ARIZ algorithm for complex problems, combining MA+TRIZ for multi-parameter systems with contradictions, and adapting TRIZ to software/services (weight→code size, segmentation→microservices).
