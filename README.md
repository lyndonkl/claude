## Skills by Category

### 🧠 Strategic Thinking & Decision Making

**decision-matrix** - Multi-criteria decision analysis with weighted scoring, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty handling for complex choices between 3-10 options.

**bayesian-reasoning-calibration** - Probabilistic reasoning with prior/posterior updates, Bayes theorem application, and calibration techniques for reducing overconfidence.

**alignment-values-north-star** - Strategic alignment framework connecting daily decisions to core values and long-term vision using north star metrics and principle mapping.

**environmental-scanning-foresight** - Anticipate change through PESTLE analysis, weak signal detection, scenario planning (2x2 matrix), cross-impact analysis, and signposts for early warning systems.

**expected-value** - Rational decision-making under uncertainty through probability-weighted outcomes (EV = Σ p×v). Covers scenario identification, probability estimation (base rates, triangulation, calibration), payoff quantification (NPV, non-monetary factors), decision trees (fold-back induction, optionality), expected utility for risk aversion, sensitivity analysis, and bias mitigation (overconfidence, sunk costs, tail risk neglect).

**heuristics-and-checklists** - Practical decision-making through mental shortcuts (heuristics) and systematic error prevention (checklists). Design fast & frugal heuristics (recognition, take-the-best, satisficing), create effective checklists (5-9 killer items, READ-DO vs DO-CONFIRM formats), validate rules empirically (≥80% accuracy target), and mitigate cognitive biases (availability, representativeness, anchoring). Covers aviation, surgical, and software deployment checklists with proven 60-80% error reduction.

**hypotheticals-counterfactuals** - Explore alternative scenarios and test assumptions through "what if" thinking. Use counterfactual reasoning (backward-looking: "what would have happened if?") to understand causality and learn from decisions. Apply scenario planning (forward-looking: optimistic/baseline/pessimistic futures, 2×2 matrices) to prepare for uncertainty. Conduct rigorous pre-mortems (6-step process: imagine failure, identify causes, vote on risks, assign mitigations). Extract common actions, hedges, and options from scenarios. Define leading indicators with clear thresholds for monitoring which future unfolds. Covers minimal rewrite principle, causal mechanism specification, probability calibration, and stress testing decisions.

### 💡 Problem Solving & Analysis

**decomposition-reconstruction** - Break complex problems into components, analyze independently, then reconstruct with understanding of interactions and emergent properties.

**causal-inference-root-cause** - Identify true causes vs. correlations using causal diagrams, counterfactuals, and root cause analysis (5 Whys, Ishikawa diagrams).

**abstraction-concrete-examples** - Move fluidly between abstract concepts and concrete examples to clarify thinking, test understanding, and communicate effectively.

**layered-reasoning** *(coming soon)* - Multi-level reasoning across different abstraction layers.

### 🔬 Research & Discovery

**discovery-interviews-surveys** - Design and conduct user research using jobs-to-be-done interviews, surveys, thematic coding, and statistical analysis while avoiding bias.

**design-of-experiments** - Plan rigorous experiments using factorial designs, response surface methodology, Taguchi methods, and statistical power analysis.

**domain-research-health-science** - Formulate clinical research questions (PICOT framework), evaluate evidence quality using GRADE certainty ratings, systematic bias assessment (Cochrane RoB 2, ROBINS-I, QUADAS-2), and conduct systematic reviews with meta-analysis.

### 🗣️ Dialogue & Deliberation

**deliberation-debate-red-teaming** - Structured debate formats (Oxford, fishbowl, devil's advocate) with red teaming for stress-testing ideas and uncovering blindspots.

**dialectical-mapping-steelmanning** - Present opposing positions in strongest form (steelmanning), map principles using Toulmin model, synthesize via third-way solutions.

**chain-roleplay-debate-synthesis** - Multi-perspective roleplay with expert personas, structured debate, and synthesis across viewpoints for complex decisions.

### 💭 Ideation & Creativity

**brainstorm-diverge-converge** - Divergent ideation (generate many ideas) followed by convergent clustering and prioritization using affinity mapping and dot voting.

**constraint-based-creativity** - Generate creative solutions by systematically applying constraints (remove, combine, extreme, reverse) to force novel thinking.

**morphological-analysis-triz** *(coming soon)* - Systematic innovation using morphological boxes and TRIZ principles.

### 📊 Data & Modeling

**data-schema-knowledge-modeling** - Design data schemas, knowledge graphs, and conceptual models with entity-relationship diagrams and ontology patterns.

**code-data-analysis-scaffolds** - Generate code scaffolds for data analysis, visualization, and statistical testing across Python, R, and SQL.

**metrics-tree** *(coming soon)* - Decompose high-level metrics into actionable sub-metrics.

### 🏗️ Architecture & Design

**adr-architecture** - Document architecture decisions with context, options considered, consequences, and tradeoffs using Architecture Decision Records.

**chain-spec-risk-metrics** - Progressive refinement from specification → risk analysis → success metrics with cross-validation at each stage.

**information-architecture** *(coming soon)* - Organize information for findability and usability.

### 📝 Communication & Documentation

**communication-storytelling** - Craft compelling narratives using story arcs, tension-resolution, concrete details, and audience-specific framing.

**writer** - Transform writing into precise, compelling prose using structured revision (Zinsser, King, Pinker), structural architecture (McPhee), and stickiness techniques (SUCCESs framework).

**one-pager-prd** *(coming soon)* - Create concise one-pagers and product requirement documents.

### 🎯 Estimation & Forecasting

**chain-estimation-decision-storytelling** - Fermi estimation → decision recommendation → compelling narrative for presenting quantitative insights.

**estimation-fermi** - Order-of-magnitude estimation via decomposition (top-down, bottom-up, rate×time), bounding techniques, triangulation, and anchoring for market sizing, resource planning, and feasibility checks.

### 💼 Business & Product Management

**financial-unit-economics** - Analyze business model viability through customer profitability metrics (CAC, LTV, contribution margin). Calculate fully-loaded acquisition costs, cohort-based lifetime value, LTV/CAC ratio (target >3:1), payback period (<12 months), conduct channel-level analysis, and provide actionable recommendations on pricing, retention, and growth strategy. Covers SaaS, e-commerce, marketplace, freemium, and enterprise models.

**facilitation-patterns** - Design and run productive group sessions (meetings, workshops, brainstorms, retrospectives) using proven facilitation patterns. Select appropriate formats (divergent brainstorm, convergent decision, alignment session), design time-boxed agendas with diverge-converge flow, manage participation dynamics (round robin, silent writing, breakouts), handle difficult situations (dominators, conflict, tangents), and apply decision-making methods (consensus, consent, vote, advisory). Includes remote and hybrid facilitation techniques.

### ⏱️ Productivity & Focus

**focus-timeboxing-8020** - Manage attention and maximize high-impact work through 80/20 principle (identify vital few tasks), timeboxing (Pomodoro 25min, deep work 90-120min blocks), and energy management. Design distraction-free focus blocks, batch similar tasks (email 2×/day, meeting blocks), match work intensity to energy levels (peak hours for deep work, trough for admin), and use Parkinson's Law (time constraints force decisions). Includes weekly/daily planning templates, execution discipline techniques, and progressive focus training.

### 🛡️ Ethics & Evaluation

**ethics-safety-impact** - Systematic ethical assessment using stakeholder mapping, fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds, calibration), harm/benefit analysis with risk scoring, privacy-preserving techniques (differential privacy, k-anonymity), and comprehensive monitoring frameworks for responsible AI and product development.

**evaluation-rubrics** - Design reliable evaluation rubrics with explicit criteria, appropriate scales (1-5, qualitative, binary), observable descriptors, inter-rater reliability measurement (Kappa ≥0.70), calibration techniques, bias mitigation (halo, central tendency), and weighted scoring for consistent quality assessment.
