# Actual Claude Skills Documentation - Corrections

## Critical Errors Found in My Previous Analysis

### ❌ ERROR 1: File Naming Convention
**What I said**: `README.md`, then `skills.md`, then `skill.md`
**ACTUAL**: `SKILL.md` (ALL CAPS)

### ❌ ERROR 2: Skill Invocation Understanding
**What I implied**: Skills are manually invoked by users
**ACTUAL**: Claude sees metadata (name + description) and decides when to load the skill automatically

### ❌ ERROR 3: File Structure
**What I proposed**: Complex multi-level directory with many subdirectories
**ACTUAL**: Simple structure - skill folder contains SKILL.md at root, optional resources/, scripts/, templates/

### ❌ ERROR 4: Additional Files
**What I said**: Create many separate .md files in layers/, toolkits/, workflows/ directories
**ACTUAL**: Use resources/ directory for supporting files, can reference REFERENCE.md

### ❌ ERROR 5: Skill Description
**What I missed**: YAML frontmatter is REQUIRED with specific character limits
**ACTUAL**:
- `name`: max 64 characters
- `description`: max 1024 characters (one-line)

### ❌ ERROR 6: Skill Naming Best Practice
**What I missed**: Naming convention recommendation
**ACTUAL**: Use gerund form (verb + -ing) like "Writing Blog Posts", "Analyzing Data"

## What I Got RIGHT ✅

1. ✅ Skills can include scripts (Python, JS)
2. ✅ Skills should be focused and modular
3. ✅ Multiple focused skills compose better than one large skill
4. ✅ Clear descriptions are important
5. ✅ Examples are valuable
6. ✅ Step-by-step instructions work well

## ACTUAL Claude Skills Structure

### Correct Directory Structure
```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: Main skill file (ALL CAPS)
├── resources/            # Optional: Supporting markdown/text files
│   ├── reference.md
│   ├── examples.md
│   └── checklist.txt
├── scripts/              # Optional: Executable code
│   ├── helper.py
│   └── analyzer.sh
└── templates/            # Optional: Structured prompts or forms
    └── template.md
```

### SKILL.md Format (REQUIRED)
```markdown
---
name: Skill Name Here
description: One-line description of what this skill does and when to use it (max 1024 chars)
---

# Skill Name Here

## Purpose
[What this skill does]

## When to Use
[Specific use cases]

## Instructions
[Step-by-step guidance for Claude]

## Examples
[Concrete examples]

## Resources
Reference REFERENCE.md for supplemental information
Reference scripts/helper.py for analysis tools
```

### How Skills Actually Work

1. **Discovery Phase**:
   - Claude sees YAML frontmatter (name + description) from all available skills
   - Claude decides which skills are relevant to current task

2. **Loading Phase**:
   - Only when skill is relevant, Claude loads full SKILL.md content
   - Can reference additional files in resources/
   - Can execute scripts in scripts/

3. **Location Options**:
   - `~/.claude/skills/my-skill/` - Personal skills (all projects)
   - `.claude/skills/my-skill/` - Project skills (shared with team)
   - Plugin skills subdirectory

### Best Practices (ACTUAL)

1. **Focus**: Create separate skills for different workflows
2. **Composability**: Multiple focused skills compose better than one large skill
3. **Clear Descriptions**: Claude uses descriptions to decide when to invoke
4. **Gerund Names**: "Creating Financial Models", "Analyzing Data", "Writing Blog Posts"
5. **Resource References**: Use REFERENCE.md for supplemental info
6. **Executable Code**: Can attach scripts that Claude can run

# Writing Mentor

## Purpose
Guide users through professional writing processes using techniques from McPhee, Zinsser, King, Lamott, Pinker, Clark, Klinkenborg, and the Heath brothers.

## When to Use
- Writing something new from scratch
- Revising and polishing existing drafts
- Structuring ideas and organizing content
- Making messages more memorable and sticky
- Applying specific writing techniques

## Core Process

### 1. Understand Intent
- What are you writing?
- Who is your audience?
- What must they remember?

### 2. Choose Workflow
Based on your situation, I'll guide you through:
- **Full Process**: New piece from idea to polished draft
- **Revision**: Improve existing draft (4-pass system)
- **Structure**: Blueprint your piece before drafting
- **Stickiness**: Make your message memorable

### 3. Apply Techniques
I'll pull from these expert methods:
- McPhee's structural diagramming
- Zinsser's clarity principles
- King's revision formula (cut 10-25%)
- Pinker's cognitive load reduction
- Heath's SUCCESs model for stickiness
- Clark's gold coin moments
- Klinkenborg's sentence precision

### 4. Use Tools
I can run analysis scripts to:
- Analyze text statistics and readability
- Detect clutter (adverbs, qualifiers, passive voice)
- Check sentence variety and rhythm
- Assess message stickiness

## Resources Available
- REFERENCE.md: Comprehensive guide to all techniques
- revision-guide.md: Four-pass revision system
- structure-types.md: McPhee's structural diagrams
- success-model.md: Heath's SUCCESs framework
- examples.md: Before/after demonstrations
- checklists.md: Quick reference for each workflow

## Analysis Scripts
- scripts/analyze-text.py: Word count, reading level, statistics
- scripts/detect-clutter.py: Find weak constructions
- scripts/sentence-variety.py: Analyze rhythm and flow
- scripts/success-checker.py: Interactive stickiness assessment

## Example Workflow: Revision

**Step 1**: Share your draft
**Step 2**: I'll analyze it with scripts
**Step 3**: We'll do four passes:
  - Pass 1: Cut clutter (Zinsser/King)
  - Pass 2: Reduce cognitive load (Pinker)
  - Pass 3: Improve rhythm (Clark)
  - Pass 4: Enhance message (Heath)
**Step 4**: You get revised draft + improvement stats

## Philosophy
1. Clarity over ornament (Zinsser)
2. Structure is destiny (McPhee)
3. Write daily, cut mercilessly (King)
4. Mess first, refine later (Lamott)
5. Read the reader's mind (Pinker)
6. Tools not rules (Clark)
7. Sentence is the thought (Klinkenborg)
8. Stickiness is design (Heath)

Reference REFERENCE.md for detailed techniques and examples.

## Key Changes Needed

### 1. Consolidate Structure
**OLD APPROACH**: 26+ separate files across multiple directories
**NEW APPROACH**:
- 1 SKILL.md file (main skill)
- 5-7 files in resources/ directory
- 4 scripts in scripts/ directory
- Total: ~10-12 files instead of 26+

### 2. Simplify Workflow
**OLD APPROACH**: Complex router with 7 separate workflow definition files
**NEW APPROACH**: Single SKILL.md with workflow guidance, reference resources as needed

### 3. YAML Frontmatter
**OLD APPROACH**: Didn't include this
**NEW APPROACH**: REQUIRED at top of SKILL.md
```yaml
---
name: Writing Mentor
description: Transform writing into precise, compelling prose using structured process, revision techniques, and stickiness principles
---
```

### 4. Resource References
**OLD APPROACH**: Assumed all content in one file
**NEW APPROACH**: Reference additional resources explicitly
```markdown
For detailed revision techniques, see resources/revision-guide.md
For structure types, see resources/structure-types.md
```

### 5. Skill Naming
**OLD APPROACH**: "Writer Skill"
**NEW APPROACH**: "Writing Mentor" (gerund would be better: "Writing with Expert Techniques" or "Mentoring Writers")

---

## Major Conceptual Errors in My Analysis

### 1. ❌ Misunderstood Skill Invocation
I thought users would manually invoke skills and choose workflows interactively.

**REALITY**: Claude automatically sees skill metadata and loads skills when relevant. The skill should be self-contained guidance, not an interactive menu system.

### 2. ❌ Over-Engineered Structure
I created a complex multi-directory structure with separate workflow files.

**REALITY**: Keep it simple - SKILL.md at root, supporting files in resources/, scripts in scripts/.

### 3. ❌ Thought README.md Was Standard
I assumed standard repository conventions applied.

**REALITY**: Claude Skills have their own convention: SKILL.md (ALL CAPS)

### 4. ❌ Missed YAML Frontmatter Requirement
I didn't know about the required frontmatter.

**REALITY**: YAML frontmatter with name and description is REQUIRED and has character limits.

### 5. ❌ Didn't Understand Automatic Loading
I thought all content would always be loaded.

**REALITY**: Claude sees metadata first, only loads full content when skill is relevant. This means description is CRITICAL.

---

## Corrected Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Skill (2-3 hours)
1. Create `writer/SKILL.md` with proper YAML frontmatter
2. Write comprehensive main skill content
3. Create `resources/REFERENCE.md` with all techniques

### Phase 2: Resources (3-4 hours)
4. Create `resources/revision-guide.md`
5. Create `resources/structure-types.md`
6. Create `resources/success-model.md`
7. Create `resources/examples.md`
8. Create `resources/checklists.md`

### Phase 3: Scripts (2-3 hours)
9. Build `scripts/analyze-text.py`
10. Build `scripts/detect-clutter.py`
11. Build `scripts/sentence-variety.py`
12. Build `scripts/success-checker.py`

**Total: ~10-12 files, 7-10 hours**

Much simpler than my original 26+ files, 14-20 hours estimate!

## What This Means for the Writer Skill

### Simplified Approach

Instead of building a complex interactive system with workflow routing, we should build:

1. **One comprehensive SKILL.md** that:
   - Has proper YAML frontmatter
   - Provides clear guidance for all writing scenarios
   - References resources as needed
   - Explains when to use each technique

2. **Well-organized resources/** containing:
   - Detailed guides for each major technique
   - Examples and before/after demonstrations
   - Quick reference checklists
   - Comprehensive reference material

3. **Useful scripts/** that:
   - Provide objective analysis
   - Help identify issues
   - Support the writing process

### How It Will Actually Work

**User has a draft to revise:**
- Claude sees "Writing Mentor" skill is relevant
- Loads SKILL.md content
- Guides user through revision process
- References resources/revision-guide.md for techniques
- Runs scripts/detect-clutter.py for analysis
- Helps improve the draft

**User wants to write something new:**
- Claude sees "Writing Mentor" skill is relevant
- Loads SKILL.md content
- Guides through intent → structure → draft → revise
- References resources/structure-types.md for blueprints
- References resources/success-model.md for stickiness
- Helps create polished piece

## Action Items

1. ✅ Documented actual Claude Skills structure
2. ⏳ Create corrected SKILL.md template
3. ⏳ Revise resource file plan (consolidate from 15+ to ~6)
4. ⏳ Update implementation timeline
5. ⏳ Rewrite all scratchpad notes with corrections

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify documentation** - I made assumptions without actually reading the docs
2. **Don't over-engineer** - Simpler is better
3. **Understand the platform** - Claude Skills work differently than I assumed
4. **RTFM** - Read The Actual Documentation before planning
5. **Test assumptions** - The user was right to test me!

Thank you for catching my errors! This will result in a much better, simpler skill.
