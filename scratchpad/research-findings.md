# Research Findings for Writer Skill

## 1. John McPhee's Structural Diagramming

### Origin
Learned from high school English teacher Mrs. McKee, who required structural outlines before drafting - could be "anything from Roman numerals I, II, III to a looping doodle with guiding arrows and stick figures."

### Philosophy
- Structure should arise from within the material, not imposed upon it
- "It is meant to be about as visible as someone's bones" - invisible to readers
- Creates diagrams for everything he writes
- Some are "almost no sense — they look like the late-stage wall sketches of a hermit stuck in a cave"
- Others are radically simple

### Specific Structure Examples

#### 1. Dual Profile Structure
- X in the middle = person being profiled
- Dots around the edge = people being interviewed about that person
- Used for single-person profiles

#### 2. Triple Profile Structure
- Three connected dual profiles with a common protagonist
- Common denominator as main character while three others share spotlight
- Example: "Encounters with the Archdruid" (Dave Brouwer - climber, environmentalist)

#### 3. Circular/Cyclical Structure
- Start narrative on day 5 of a trip
- Continue to day 9
- Flash back to day 1 (told in past tense)
- Return to day 5
- Maintains momentum while providing context

#### 4. Other Diagrams
- Horizontal line with loops above and below = tangents along storyline
- Circle with lines shooting out = narrative pathways
- Can be completely idiosyncratic to the piece

### Implementation for Skill
**Reference file should include:**
- Visual examples of each structure type
- When to use each structure
- How to diagram your own piece
- Exercise: diagram 3 different ways to tell the same story
- Template diagrams users can adapt

## 2. Roy Peter Clark's Gold Coins

### The Metaphor
Walking on a forest path, you see a gold coin shining ahead. You pick it up and move forward quickly searching for more. You keep finding them and keep moving forward until the gold runs out.

### Definition
Gold coins are craft techniques that:
1. Entice readers to keep reading
2. Reward them for doing so
3. Maintain interest throughout (especially in the middle)

### What Qualifies as a Gold Coin
- Anecdotes
- Examples
- Good quotes
- Interesting facts
- Humor
- Amazing facts
- Startling insights
- Beautiful metaphors
- Fresh turns of phrase
- Intriguing characters

### Strategy
- **Avoid top-heavy stories**: Don't front-load all the good stuff
- **Distribute throughout**: Strategic placement from beginning to end
- **Especially in the middle**: Combat the "saggy middle" syndrome
- **Reward the reader**: Each coin is a payoff for continued reading

### Implementation for Skill
**Reference file should include:**
- Checklist of what counts as a gold coin
- Exercise: identify gold coins in sample text
- Exercise: add 3 gold coins to a draft
- Placement strategy guide
- Examples of well-placed gold coins
- Before/after examples

## 3. Heath Brothers' SUCCESs Model

### The Six Principles

#### S - Simple
- Strip message to core essence
- Focus on the most important idea
- One-sentence statements with profound depth
- Example: The Golden Rule - lifetime of learning in one sentence

**Key question**: What's the single most important thing to communicate?

#### U - Unexpected
- Get Attention through Surprise
- Keep Attention through Interest
- Break schemas/patterns
- Violate expectations
- Create curiosity gaps

**Key question**: What will surprise them? What will keep them interested?

#### C - Concrete
- Use specific, tangible details
- Avoid abstractions
- Make it sensory
- Grounded in physical reality

**Key question**: Can they visualize this?

#### C - Credible
- Use convincing details
- Statistics (but human-scale)
- Testability - "try it yourself"
- Sinatra Test ("If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere")
- Authority, but also anti-authority
- Internal credibility from details

**Key question**: Why should they believe this?

#### E - Emotional
- People must care before they act
- Focus on individuals, not masses (Mother Teresa: "If I look at the mass, I will never act")
- Use associations
- Appeal to self-interest
- Appeal to identity

**Key question**: Why should they care?

#### S - Stories
- Mental simulation - readers put themselves in protagonist's shoes
- Understand emotions
- Problem-solve vicariously
- Develop skills through narrative
- Three types: Challenge plot, Connection plot, Creativity plot

**Key question**: What story demonstrates this?

### Real-World Examples

**CSPI Movie Theater Popcorn Campaign**
- Concrete: "A medium popcorn has more artery-clogging fat than a bacon-and-eggs breakfast, Big Mac and fries for lunch, and steak dinner with all the trimmings—combined!"
- Unexpected: Shocking comparison
- Credible: Specific measurements
- Result: Massive media coverage, industry change

**Save the Children**
- Story of individual child (not statistics about millions)
- Concrete details about one person
- Emotional connection to specific individual
- Result: More donations than mass statistics

**Blue Eye/Brown Eye Exercise**
- Story: Iowa teacher's prejudice lesson after MLK assassination
- Concrete: Actual experience, not lecture
- Emotional: Students felt discrimination
- Unexpected: Elementary school experiment
- Result: Profound, lasting impact

### Implementation for Skill
**Reference file should include:**
- Detailed breakdown of each principle
- Questions to test each element
- Score card (rate your piece 1-6 on each)
- Examples for each principle
- Common mistakes for each
- Exercise: apply all 6 to a single paragraph

## 4. Verlyn Klinkenborg's Sentence Philosophy

### Core Maxims
1. **All writing is revision**
2. **Good writing is one strong sentence after another**

### Philosophy
- Most received wisdom about writing is "not only wrong but harmful"
- Focus on the sentence as the fundamental unit
- Writing as sentence work: making, fixing, killing, arranging sentences
- No gospel, orthodoxy, or dogma - personal philosophy and starting points

### Key Principles

#### One Sentence = One Thought
- Each sentence should contain one clear idea
- Avoid compound complexity
- Split compound sentences

#### Eliminate Transitional Clutter
- Boldly eliminate transitions and conjunctions
- Trust the reader to make connections
- Let sentences stand on their own

#### Don't Save Your Point for the End
- Front-load meaning
- Be direct
- Don't make readers wait

#### Revise by Deleting
- Cutting is the primary revision tool
- Remove what doesn't contribute
- Trust in brevity

#### Read Aloud for Cadence
- The ear knows what works
- Rhythm matters
- Sound reveals problems

#### Replace Placeholder Sentences
- Identify sentences that don't "move"
- Each sentence must advance thought
- No filler, no padding

### Practical Techniques
- Short sentences create clarity
- Active voice preference
- Concrete over abstract
- See clearly, write what you see
- Sentence as meditation on thought and attention

### Implementation for Skill
**Reference file should include:**
- Exercise: write 12 short sentences describing a scene
- Exercise: turn a long sentence into 3 short ones
- Exercise: identify and kill placeholder sentences
- Before/after examples
- Reading aloud checklist
- Common sentence problems and fixes

## 5. Steven Pinker's Cognitive Load & Garden Paths

### Garden Path Sentences
**Definition**: Sentences that "lure the reader into interpreting a phrase in one sense when in truth it is meant in another, a fact that is made clear only at the end."

**Effect**: Turn reading "from an effortless glide through a sentence to a tedious two-step of little backtracks."

### Examples

**Bad**: "A faculty panel on sex in college with four professors"
- Garden path: Sounds like sex WITH four professors
- Intended: Panel discussion BY four professors ABOUT sex in college

**Bad**: "U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Baghdad on Wednesday to endorse the new Iraqi government hours before President Barack Obama will address the American people"
- Garden path: Sounds like endorsing "government hours"
- Intended: Arrived hours before Obama's address

### Cognitive Load Principles

#### 1. Signal Topic Early
- Don't bury the lede at sentence level
- Lead with what the sentence is about
- Orient the reader immediately

#### 2. Keep Subject-Verb-Object Close
- Minimize distance between key elements
- Don't insert long clauses between subject and verb
- Reduce working memory load

#### 3. Avoid Temporary Ambiguities
- Garden paths are temporary ambiguities
- Reader parses one way, then must backtrack
- Exhausting for reader

#### 4. Map Coherence via Topic Chains
- Each sentence connects to previous
- Topic flows logically
- Reader can follow without effort

#### 5. Understand Parsing Load
- How much work is the reader doing?
- Complex syntax = high cognitive load
- Simple syntax = low cognitive load

#### 6. Memory Span Matters
- Readers can only hold so much in working memory
- Long sentences with nested clauses overload
- Break up complex ideas

### Beyond Traditional Advice

**Traditional (useless)**: "Keep related words together"
**Pinker (useful)**: Apply psycholinguistic research about how readers actually process sentences

### Implementation for Skill
**Reference file should include:**
- Garden path detector (test sentences)
- Subject-verb-object proximity checker
- Coherence mapping exercise
- Cognitive load assessment
- Examples of high vs. low load sentences
- Rewriting exercises
- Before/after examples
- Topic chain analysis technique
