# Writer Skill - Build Ready Summary

## Status: ✅ Analysis Complete - Ready to Build

All research, planning, and design work is complete. We have comprehensive documentation ready for implementation.

---

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Analyzed Original Prompt
- Deconstructed the 7-layer framework
- Identified core principles and influences
- Understood the philosophy and approach
- **File**: `writer-skill-analysis.md`

### 2. ✅ Identified Workflows
We've defined 7 distinct workflows:
1. Full Writing Process (new piece start to finish)
2. Intent & Structure Planning (planning phase)
3. Drafting Session (get words down)
4. Revision & Polish (most common use case)
5. Toolkit Application (specific technique)
6. Stickiness Check (make it memorable)
7. Structure Consultation (solve organization problems)

### 3. ✅ Designed File Structure
Complete architecture with 26+ files organized into:
- Core layer references (7 files)
- Toolkit references (5 files)
- Workflow definitions (7 files)
- Scripts (4-6 files)
- Examples and documentation

### 4. ✅ Researched Best Practices
Deep research on all five major influences:
- **McPhee**: Structural diagramming with visual blueprints
- **Clark**: Gold coin moments for reader engagement
- **Heath**: Complete SUCCESs model with examples
- **Klinkenborg**: Sentence-level philosophy and techniques
- **Pinker**: Cognitive load and garden path avoidance
- **File**: `research-findings.md`

### 5. ✅ Created Implementation Plan
Detailed specifications for:
- Every file to be created
- Every script to be written
- Workflow logic and routing
- User experience flows
- Success metrics
- Build order and timeline
- **File**: `implementation-plan.md`

---

## Key Design Decisions

### Architecture
- **Single skill, multiple workflows** (not separate sub-skills)
- **Modular reference files** (not one giant prompt)
- **Progressive disclosure** (don't overwhelm)
- **Flexible entry points** (users enter at different stages)

### User Experience
- **Question-based routing** to appropriate workflow
- **Checklist-driven progress** through each phase
- **Just-in-time reference loading** (pull in docs as needed)
- **Script integration** at natural checkpoints
- **Artifact generation** (save work products)

### Technical Approach
- **Python 3.8+** for scripts (widely available)
- **Minimal dependencies** (maximize portability)
- **Graceful error handling** (never crash)
- **Both interactive and batch modes** for scripts

---

## File Inventory

### Must-Have for MVP (Phase 1) - 7 files
1. `skills.md` - Main skill definition and router
2. `workflows/revision-and-polish.md` - Most used workflow
3. `layers/04-revision-engine.md` - Four-pass revision system
4. `layers/05-messaging-stickiness.md` - SUCCESs model
5. `scripts/analyze-text.py` - Text statistics
6. `scripts/detect-clutter.py` - Clutter detection
7. `docs/quick-reference-checklist.md` - Quick checklists

### Phase 2 - 11 additional files

User: ~/blog/ai-agents-post.md
Skill: [Reads and analyzes] Found 1,234 words, 56 sentences...
```

**Step 3**: Clutter pass
```
Skill: Running clutter detection...
Skill: Found 34 potential clutter words. Let's tackle adverbs first...
Skill: [Shows examples with line numbers]
User: [Makes revisions]
```

**Step 4**: Cognition pass
```
Skill: Now let's check for readability...
Skill: I found 3 potential garden-path sentences...
Skill: [Shows examples and suggests fixes]

```

**Step 5**: Rhythm pass
```
Skill: Running sentence variety analysis...
Skill: Lines 23-27 show monotonous pattern (all 18-20 words)

User: [Makes revisions]
```

**Step 6**: Message pass
```
Skill: Let's check your message stickiness...

## Integration with Claude Skills Best Practices

### ✅ Clear Scope
- Single responsibility: Guide writing process
- Well-defined boundaries: Not for grammar, formatting, citations

### ✅ Structured Instructions
- Step-by-step workflows
- Decision points (which workflow?)
- Conditionals (if draft exists... if new piece...)

### ✅ Layered Information
- Core: Workflow definitions
- Context: Layer references
- Examples: Example files
- Edge cases: Troubleshooting sections
- Constraints: When NOT to use

### ✅ Error Handling
- File not found → ask for correct path
- Script fails → continue without it
- Unclear intent → ask clarifying questions

### ✅ Modularity
- Each workflow is self-contained
- Reference files are independent
- Scripts are separate utilities

### ✅ Composability
- Workflows can be chained
- References can be mixed
- Scripts can be run standalone

### ✅ Testability
- Clear success criteria for each workflow
- Validation checkpoints throughout
- Measurable outcomes (word count reduction, stickiness score)

---

## Build Recommendation

### Start Here: MVP (4-6 hours)

**Priority 1: Create file structure**
```bash
mkdir -p skills/writer/{workflows,layers,toolkits,scripts,examples,docs}
```

**Priority 2: Write skills.md**
- Router logic
- Workflow descriptions
- Entry point experience

**Priority 3: Build revision workflow**
- `workflows/revision-and-polish.md`
- `layers/04-revision-engine.md`
- `layers/05-messaging-stickiness.md`

**Priority 4: Create essential scripts**
- `scripts/analyze-text.py`
- `scripts/detect-clutter.py`

**Priority 5: Test end-to-end**
- Take a real draft through the workflow
- Verify all pieces work together
- Iterate on UX

### Then: Expand (6-8 hours)
- Add full writing process workflow
- Create intent discovery and structure layers
- Build remaining workflows
- Add toolkit references

### Finally: Polish (4-6 hours)
- Create rich examples
- Build remaining scripts
- Write comprehensive documentation
- Final testing and refinement

## Open Questions for User

Before we start building, let's confirm:

1. **Script language**: Python OK? (vs Bash or other)
2. **Depth preference**: Start with MVP or build all at once?
3. **Example strategy**: Create original examples or reference public domain?
4. **Save location**: Where should skill artifacts be saved by default?
5. **Interactivity level**: How much guidance vs. independence?

---

## Next Step

**Recommended**: Review this summary and the detailed files in scratchpad:
- `writer-skill-analysis.md` - Initial analysis
- `research-findings.md` - Detailed research on each technique
- `implementation-plan.md` - Comprehensive specifications

**Then**: Give the go-ahead and we'll start building!

**Suggested command**: "Let's build the MVP, starting with the file structure and skills.md"

## Confidence Level: HIGH

✅ Clear understanding of requirements
✅ Comprehensive research completed
✅ Detailed specifications written

✅ Technical approach validated
✅ Success criteria defined

**Ready to build: YES**
**Estimated quality: HIGH** (based on thorough planning)

## Final Thought

This skill will be **substantially more than a prompt**. It will be:
- An interactive coach
- A process guide
- A toolkit library
- An analysis suite
- A deliverable generator

It transforms the original prompt from a set of instructions into an **active writing partner** that walks with users through the creative process.

Let's build it! 🚀
