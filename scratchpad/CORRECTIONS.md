# Corrections and Updates

## File Naming Convention - CORRECTED ✅

**Issue**: Initial analysis incorrectly referenced the main skill file as `README.md`

**Correction**: According to Claude Code documentation, the main skill file should be named `skills.md`

**Files Updated**:
- ✅ writer-skill-analysis.md
- ✅ implementation-plan.md
- ✅ BUILD-READY-SUMMARY.md

**Correct Structure**:
```
skills/writer/
├── skills.md          # Main skill definition (CORRECT)
├── workflows/
├── layers/
├── toolkits/
├── scripts/
├── examples/
└── docs/
```

All planning documents have been updated to reflect the correct filename.
