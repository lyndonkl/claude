## Purpose Identification

### Before Writing Any Email

**Ask yourself:**
1. What is the ONE thing I need from this email?
2. What action should the recipient take?
3. By when do I need it?
4. What context do they need to respond?

### Common Email Purposes

| Purpose | Clear Ask Example |
|---------|-------------------|
| Request meeting | "Would you be available for a 30-minute call next week?" |
| Share information | "I'm sharing X for your awareness. No action needed." |
| Request feedback | "Could you review the attached by [date]?" |
| Make introduction | "Would you be willing to connect with [person]?" |
| Follow up | "Following up on [topic]. Any updates?" |
| Thank/acknowledge | "Thank you for [specific thing]." |

### Red Flags (Email Not Ready)

- You can't state the purpose in one sentence
- You have multiple unrelated asks
- You're not sure what you want them to do
- There's no timeline for response

## Tone Calibration

### Relationship-Based Tone

**New Contact / Senior / Formal:**
```
Opening: "Dear Dr. [Name]," or "Dear Professor [Name],"
Tone: Formal, respectful, no assumptions
Sign-off: "Sincerely," or "Best regards,"
```

**Established Contact / Peer:**
```
Opening: "Dear [First Name]," or "Hi [First Name],"
Tone: Professional but warm, can reference shared context
Sign-off: "Best," or "Best regards,"
```

**Close Collaborator:**
```
Opening: "Hi [Name],"
Tone: Friendly but professional, informal acceptable
Sign-off: "Best," or "Thanks,"
```

### Context-Based Tone

| Situation | Tone Adjustment |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Bad news (rejection, delay) | Extra warmth, acknowledge difficulty |
| Request (favor) | Grateful tone, make saying yes easy |
| Disagreement | Diplomatic, acknowledge their view first |
| Urgency | Direct but not demanding, explain why urgent |
| Good news | Warm, can be more casual |

## Response to Reviewers Strategy

### Mindset

- Reviewers are trying to help improve the work
- They gave time and thought to your paper
- Even frustrating comments usually have valid kernels
- Your goal: Clear revision, not winning arguments

### Response Principles

**1. Be Grateful**
Even for harsh criticism: "We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful comment."

**2. Address Everything**
Every comment needs a response. Even minor comments: "Done."

**3. Quote Then Respond**
Format reviewer comment clearly, then your response. Never paraphrase in a way that changes meaning.

**4. Show Your Work**
Describe what you changed AND where (page, line numbers in revised manuscript).

**5. Disagree Respectfully**
When you must: "We appreciate this perspective. However, we respectfully maintain X because [evidence/reason]."

### Responding to Common Comment Types

**Clarification request:**
"Thank you for noting this lack of clarity. We have revised [section] to explicitly state [point]. The revised text now reads: '[new text]' (page X, lines Y-Z)."

**Additional experiment request:**
If doing it: "We agree this strengthens the manuscript. We have performed [experiment] and added the results as [Figure/text]. See page X."
If not: "We appreciate this suggestion. While this would be interesting, we believe it is beyond the scope of the current study because [reason]. However, we have added this as a future direction in the Discussion (page X, line Y)."

**Disagreement with interpretation:**
"We thank the reviewer for raising this alternative interpretation. While we understand this perspective, our interpretation is supported by [specific evidence]. To clarify, we have added text explaining [reasoning] on page X."

**Criticism of method:**
"The reviewer raises a valid concern about [method]. We note that [justification/limitation acknowledgment]. We have added text discussing this limitation (page X, line Y)."

## Email Length Guidelines

### Rule of Thumb

Most professional emails should be readable in under 2 minutes. That means:
- 3-5 short paragraphs maximum
- Each paragraph 2-4 sentences
- One screen of text (no scrolling needed)

### When Longer Is OK

- Complex technical explanations (but consider attachment instead)
- Response to reviewers (inherently detailed)
- Formal proposals (but format carefully)

### When to Split into Multiple Emails

- Multiple unrelated topics
- Multiple unrelated asks
- Different response timelines needed
- Different recipients should handle different parts

---

## Follow-Up Strategy

### When to Follow Up

| Context | Reasonable Wait Time |
|---------|---------------------|
| Urgent business | 1-2 days |
| Standard request | 1 week |
| Busy person (editor, senior faculty) | 2 weeks |
| During conference/holiday | Add extra time |

### How to Follow Up

**First follow-up (gentle):**
```
Subject: Follow-up: [Original subject]

Hi [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my email from [date] regarding [topic]. I understand
you're busy, and I'm happy to [adjust timeline / provide more info / wait].

Please let me know if you need anything from me.

Best,
[Your name]
```

**Second follow-up (direct):**
```
Subject: Following up again: [Topic]

Hi [Name],

I'm circling back on [topic] as I haven't heard back. I need [X] by [date] to
[why timeline matters].

If this isn't the right time or right person, please let me know and I'm happy
to adjust.

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

**When to stop:**
- After 2-3 follow-ups with no response
- When they've clearly declined (sometimes silence = no)
- When you've found an alternative solution

## Common Email Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Buried Ask

**Problem:** Request hidden in paragraph 4
**Fix:** State ask in first or second paragraph; restate at end

### Mistake 2: No Timeline

**Problem:** "When you get a chance" = never
**Fix:** "Would you be able to [X] by [date]?"

### Mistake 3: Wall of Text

**Problem:** Long paragraphs without breaks
**Fix:** Short paragraphs, bullets for lists, white space

### Mistake 4: Tone Mismatch

**Problem:** Too casual for context (or too formal for relationship)
**Fix:** Match to relationship and situation

### Mistake 5: Missing Context

**Problem:** Assumes they remember previous exchange
**Fix:** Brief context even for ongoing conversations

### Mistake 6: Multiple Asks

**Problem:** Several unrelated requests in one email
**Fix:** Split into separate emails or make very clear list

### Mistake 7: CC Overuse

**Problem:** Too many people CC'd on routine exchanges
**Fix:** CC only those who need to see the exchange
