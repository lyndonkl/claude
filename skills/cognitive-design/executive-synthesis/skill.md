name: executive-synthesis
description: Use when designing visual interfaces, data visualizations, educational content, or presentations and need to ensure they align with how humans naturally perceive, process, and remember information. Invoke when user mentions cognitive load, visual hierarchy, dashboard design, form design, e-learning, infographics, or wants to improve clarity and reduce user confusion. Also applies when evaluating existing designs for cognitive alignment or choosing between design alternatives.

### What This Skill Does

This skill helps you create **cognitively aligned designs** - visual interfaces, data visualizations, educational content, and presentations that work with (not against) human perception, attention, memory, and decision-making.

**Core principle:** Effective design aligns with how people think, not just how things look.

### Why Cognitive Design Matters

**Common problems this addresses:**
- Users miss critical information in dashboards
- Complex interfaces cause cognitive overload and abandonment
- Data visualizations are misinterpreted or misleading
- Educational materials aren't retained
- Form completion rates are low
- Error messages are confusing

**How this helps:**
- Ground design decisions in cognitive psychology research
- Apply systematic frameworks (Cognitive Design Pyramid, Design Feedback Loop, Three-Layer Model)
- Evaluate designs against objective cognitive criteria
- Choose appropriate visual encodings based on perceptual hierarchy
- Manage attention, memory limits, and cognitive load

### When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill when:**
- ✓ Designing new interfaces, dashboards, visualizations, or educational content
- ✓ Users report confusion, overwhelm, or missing information
- ✓ Improving designs with poor metrics (low completion rates, high bounce rates)
- ✓ Conducting design reviews and need systematic evaluation
- ✓ Choosing between design alternatives with cognitive rationale
- ✓ Advocating for design decisions to stakeholders
- ✓ Designing high-stakes interfaces where cognitive failure has consequences

**Do NOT use for:**
- ✗ Pure aesthetic/brand identity decisions unrelated to cognition
- ✗ Technical implementation (coding, databases)
- ✗ Business strategy (feature prioritization, pricing)
- ✗ Tool-specific training (how to use Figma, Tableau, etc.)

### How This Skill Works

This is an **interactive hub** - you choose your path based on current need:

1. **Learning mode:** Start with Path 1 (Cognitive Foundations) to understand principles
2. **Application mode:** Jump to Path 2 (Frameworks) or Path 4 (Domain Guidance) to apply to specific design
3. **Evaluation mode:** Use Path 3 (Evaluation Tools) to assess existing designs
4. **Quick mode:** Use Path 6 (Quick Reference) for rapid decision-making

**After completing any path, return to the menu to select another or exit.**

### Collaborative Nature

I'll guide you through cognitive design principles by:
- Explaining WHY certain designs work (cognitive foundations)
- Providing HOW to apply principles (frameworks and workflows)
- Offering domain-specific guidance (data viz, UX, education, storytelling)
- Evaluating designs systematically (checklists and audits)

You bring domain expertise and context; I provide cognitive science grounding.

## How to Use This Skill

### Prerequisites

- Basic design literacy (familiarity with UI terminology, common chart types)
- Understanding of user tasks and context (from user research, stories, or brief)
- Access to design being created or evaluated

### Typical Session Flows

**For New Design (2-4 hours):**
1. Start with Path 1 (Cognitive Foundations) or Path 6 (Quick Reference) to orient
2. Use Path 2 (Frameworks) to structure your design thinking
3. Apply Path 4 (Domain Guidance) for specific context (dashboard, form, e-learning, etc.)
4. Evaluate with Path 3 (Evaluation Tools)
5. Check Path 5 (Common Mistakes) to avoid pitfalls
6. Iterate based on findings

**For Design Review (30-60 min):**
1. Jump to Path 3 (Evaluation Tools) for systematic assessment
2. Reference Path 5 (Common Mistakes) for quick checks
3. Use Path 6 (Quick Reference) for rapid validation
4. Note issues and prioritize fixes

**For Quick Validation (5-10 min):**
1. Path 6 (Quick Reference) for 3-question check
2. Path 3 (Evaluation Tools) for spot checks if issues found

### Expected Outcomes

**Immediate:**
- Designs with clear visual hierarchy
- Reduced cognitive load (fewer overwhelm complaints)
- Systematic evaluation process

**Short-term (weeks):**
- Improved usability metrics (completion rates, time-on-task)
- Fewer user support requests
- More defensible design decisions

**Long-term (months):**
- Internalized cognitive principles
- Team shared vocabulary
- Measurable business impact

## Path Selection Menu

**Choose your path based on current need:**

### Path 1: Understand Cognitive Foundations

**Choose this when:** You want to learn the core cognitive psychology principles underlying effective design (attention, memory, perception, Gestalt grouping, visual encoding hierarchy).

**What you'll get:** Deep understanding of WHY certain designs work, grounded in research from Tufte, Norman, Ware, Cleveland & McGill, Mayer, and others.

**Time:** 20-40 minutes

**→ [Go to Cognitive Foundations resource](resources/cognitive-foundations.md)**

---

### Path 2: Apply Design Frameworks

**Choose this when:** You want systematic frameworks to structure your design thinking and decision-making.

**What you'll get:** Three complementary frameworks:
- **Cognitive Design Pyramid** (4 tiers: Perceptual Efficiency → Cognitive Coherence → Emotional Engagement → Behavioral Alignment)
- **Design Feedback Loop** (Perceive → Interpret → Decide → Act → Learn)
- **Three-Layer Visualization Model** (Data → Visual Encoding → Cognitive Interpretation)

**Time:** 30-45 minutes

**→ [Go to Frameworks resource](resources/frameworks.md)**

---

### Path 3: Evaluate Existing Designs

**Choose this when:** You need to assess a design systematically for cognitive alignment, or conducting a design review/critique.

**What you'll get:**
- **Cognitive Design Checklist** (visibility, hierarchy, chunking, consistency, feedback, memory support)
- **Visualization Audit Framework** (4 criteria: Clarity, Efficiency, Integrity, Aesthetics)
- Examples of evaluation in practice

**Time:** 30-60 minutes (depending on design complexity)

**→ [Go to Evaluation Tools resource](resources/evaluation-tools.md)**

---

#### 4c. Educational Design (E-Learning, Training, Instructional Materials)
