# Constraint-Based Creativity Template

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

```
Constraint-Based Creativity Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Gather inputs and clarify the creative challenge
- [ ] Step 2: Select or design 1-3 strategic constraints
- [ ] Step 3: Generate 20+ ideas within constraints
- [ ] Step 4: Evaluate and refine top solutions
- [ ] Step 5: Document and validate
```

**Step 1: Gather inputs and clarify the creative challenge**

Ask user for problem/creative challenge, context (what's been tried, why stuck), success criteria, existing constraints (real limitations), and preferred constraint types (if any). Use [Input Questions](#input-questions) to gather comprehensive context.

**Step 2: Select or design 1-3 strategic constraints**

If existing constraints → Work within them creatively. If no constraints → Design strategic ones using [Constraint Selection Guide](#constraint-selection-guide). Maximum 3 constraints to avoid paralysis. Document constraint rationale in the output file.

**Step 3: Generate 20+ ideas within constraints**

Use [Idea Generation Techniques](#idea-generation-techniques) to produce volume. Document ALL ideas including "failures" - they contain insights. Aim for 20+ ideas minimum before evaluating. Quality comes after quantity.

**Step 4: Evaluate and refine top solutions**

Apply [Evaluation Framework](#evaluation-framework) to select strongest 2-3 ideas. Refine by combining elements, removing complexity, and strengthening the constraint-driven insight. Document why these solutions stand out.

**Step 5: Document and validate**

Create `constraint-based-creativity.md` file with complete documentation. Validate using [Quality Checklist](#quality-checklist) before delivering. Ensure constraint-creativity causality is explained.

## Input Questions

Ask the user to provide:

**1. Creative Challenge:**
- What needs solving, creating, or improving?
- What's the core problem or opportunity?

**2. Context:**
- What's been tried already? Why didn't it work?
- Why does ideation feel stuck or stale?
- What assumptions are currently in place?

**3. Success Criteria:**
- What does a good solution look like?
- How will you know if the constraint-based approach worked?
- Are there measurable goals (cost, time, engagement)?

**4. Existing Constraints (Real Limitations):**
- Budget limitations? (exact amount)
- Time constraints? (deadline)
- Technical limitations? (platform, tools, compatibility)
- Material/resource limitations? (team size, equipment)
- Regulatory/policy constraints? (legal, compliance)

**5. Constraint Preferences (Optional):**
- Are there specific constraint types that interest you? (resource, format, rule-based, technical, perspective)
- Any constraints you want to avoid?
- Preference for tight vs loose constraints?

## Constraint Selection Guide

**If user has existing constraints (real limitations):**

1. **Accept and amplify:** Make the constraint tighter to force more creativity
   - Budget is $5K → Challenge: "Design for $1K"
   - Timeline is 2 weeks → Challenge: "Ship in 3 days"

2. **Add complementary constraint:** Pair resource constraint with format constraint
   - Low budget + "No text, visuals only"
   - Short timeline + "Using existing tools only"

**If user has no constraints (brainstorming is just stuck):**

1. **Diagnose the stuck pattern:**
   - Ideas too complex? → Add simplicity constraint ("Maximum 3 features")
   - Ideas too conventional? → Add rule-based constraint ("Can't use industry standard approach")
   - Ideas too similar? → Add perspective constraint ("Design for opposite audience")

2. **Choose constraint type strategically:**

| Stuck Pattern | Recommended Constraint | Example |
|--------------|----------------------|---------|
| Too complex/feature-bloated | Resource or Format | "One-page explanation" or "$100 budget" |
| Too conventional | Rule-based | "Can't use competitor's approach" or "No best practices" |
| Too similar to each other | Technical or Medium | "Text-based only" or "Works offline" |
| Too vague/abstract | Format | "Explain in 6 words" or "Show with single image" |
| Too incremental | Historical or Audience | "Design as if it's 1990" or "For 5-year-olds" |

3. **Apply the "1-3 rule":**
   - 1 constraint: Safe, good for first-timers
   - 2 constraints: Sweet spot for most challenges
   - 3 constraints: Maximum before over-constraining
   - 4+ constraints: Usually paralyzes creativity (avoid)

## Idea Generation Techniques

**Technique 1: Rapid Constraint-Compliant Listing**
- Set timer for 15 minutes
- List every idea that respects constraints, no matter how wild
- Don't judge or refine - just capture volume
- Aim for 30+ ideas in timeboxed session
- Good for: Getting unstuck quickly

**Technique 2: Constraint-Focused SCAMPER**
- Apply SCAMPER prompts while respecting constraints:
  - **S**ubstitute: What can replace X (within constraints)?
  - **C**ombine: What can merge (within constraints)?
  - **A**dapt: What can we adapt from elsewhere (within constraints)?
  - **M**odify: What can we change (within constraints)?
  - **P**ut to other use: Different purpose (within constraints)?
  - **E**liminate: What can we remove (constraint might already do this)?
  - **R**everse: What can we flip (within constraints)?
- Good for: Systematic exploration

**Technique 3: Forced Connections**
- Pick 3 random elements (objects, concepts, brands)
- Force connection between challenge + random element + constraint
- Example: "App redesign" + "Coffee shop" + "No images" = Text-based app with coffee shop naming metaphors
- Good for: Breaking patterns completely

**Technique 4: Constraint Escalation**
- Start with mild constraint, generate 5 ideas
- Tighten constraint, generate 5 more
- Tighten again, generate 5 more
- Example: "$10K budget" → "$1K budget" → "$100 budget"
- Good for: Finding the creative sweet spot

**Technique 5: The "Yes, And" Game**
- Build on each idea while adding constraint layer
- Idea 1: "Simple landing page"
- Yes, and (constraint): "...with no images, text only"
- Yes, and: "...using only questions, no statements"
- Yes, and: "...in under 50 words"
- Good for: Progressive refinement

## Evaluation Framework

**Phase 1: Constraint Compliance Check**

For each idea, verify:
- [ ] Respects ALL imposed constraints (no "bending" or exceptions)
- [ ] Uses constraint as feature, not workaround (embraces limitation)
- [ ] Would be eliminated in unconstrained brainstorming (proves constraint drove it)

Eliminate any ideas that fail these checks.

**Phase 2: Problem-Solution Fit**

For remaining ideas, assess:
- [ ] Addresses the original creative challenge
- [ ] Meets success criteria (if measurable)
- [ ] Is actionable with available resources
- [ ] Differentiates from existing approaches

Rank ideas by problem fit.

**Phase 3: Novelty Assessment**

For top-ranked ideas, evaluate:
- **Novel (5)**: Completely unexpected angle, wouldn't exist without constraint
- **Fresh (4)**: Interesting twist on existing concept, constraint made it distinctive
- **Improved (3)**: Better version of known approach, constraint forced refinement
- **Incremental (2)**: Slight variation, constraint didn't add much
- **Derivative (1)**: Essentially same as existing, constraint was superficial

Select ideas scoring 4-5 for refinement.

**Phase 4: Refinement**

For selected ideas:
1. **Combine elements:** Can you merge strengths from multiple ideas?
2. **Subtract complexity:** Remove anything non-essential
3. **Strengthen constraint insight:** Make the constraint-creativity link more explicit
4. **Add implementation details:** How would this actually work?
5. **Acknowledge limitations:** Where does this solution fall short?

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Bending constraints mid-process**
- **Symptom:** "This constraint is too hard, can we adjust it?"
- **Fix:** Constraint difficulty is the point. Breakthroughs happen when you can't take the easy path.

**Pitfall 2: Accepting incremental ideas**
- **Symptom:** Ideas that are slight variations of existing approaches
- **Fix:** Use novelty assessment. If it scores < 4, keep generating.

**Pitfall 3: Over-constraining**
- **Symptom:** Zero ideas generated, complete creative paralysis
- **Fix:** Reduce to 1-2 constraints max. Add constraints progressively, not all at once.

**Pitfall 4: Arbitrary constraints**
- **Symptom:** Constraint has no relationship to the creative block
- **Fix:** Choose constraints strategically (see Constraint Selection Guide). Constraint should counter the stuck pattern.

**Pitfall 5: Skipping volume phase**
- **Symptom:** Evaluating/refining ideas before generating quantity
- **Fix:** Force 20+ ideas before any judgment. Set timer and don't stop early.

**Pitfall 6: Missing the causality**
- **Symptom:** Can't explain how constraint drove the creativity
- **Fix:** If solution could exist without constraint, it's not constraint-based creativity. Keep generating.

**Pitfall 7: Confusing constraint-based with regular brainstorming**
- **Symptom:** Treating constraints as optional or as framing device only
- **Fix:** Constraints must be enforced rigorously. They're not suggestions.

**Pitfall 8: Stopping at conceptual**
- **Symptom:** Solutions are interesting but not actionable
- **Fix:** Add implementation notes. Verify solution can actually be executed.
