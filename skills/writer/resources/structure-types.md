# McPhee's Structural Diagramming

## Philosophy

"Structure is as visible as someone's bones" - readers shouldn't notice it, but it carries everything.

Structure must:
- Arise from within the material (not imposed upon it)
- Serve the content (not the other way around)
- Be invisible to readers (they experience flow, not architecture)
- Be planned before drafting (blueprint first, build second)

## Why Structure Matters

Good structure:
- Carries readers effortlessly through your piece
- Creates natural momentum
- Supports your argument or narrative
- Places key moments strategically
- Makes complex material digestible

Bad structure (or no structure):
- Readers get lost
- Momentum stalls
- Key points get buried
- Material feels random or chaotic

## The Diagramming Method

**McPhee's Approach:**
1. Understand your material completely first
2. Identify the natural organizing principle
3. Sketch 3 different structural options
4. Select the one that best serves the content
5. Annotate with key moments and transitions

**From Mrs. McKee's Teaching:**
"Can be anything from Roman numerals I, II, III to a looping doodle with guiding arrows and stick figures"

The diagram is for you - it doesn't need to be beautiful, just functional.

## Structure Types

### 1. List Structure

**Description:** Simplest structure - one point after another in sequence.

**When to Use:**
- Multiple independent points
- How-to guides
- Tips or techniques
- When order doesn't matter much

**Diagram:**
```
1. Point A
2. Point B
3. Point C
4. Point D
```

**Example Use Case:**
"5 Ways to Improve Your Writing"
- Each technique is independent
- Order is somewhat arbitrary
- Readers can skip around

**Strength:** Simple, clear, easy to follow
**Weakness:** Can feel mechanical, lacks narrative drive

---

### 2. Chronological Structure

**Description:** Time-based progression - what happened when.

**When to Use:**
- Narratives
- Historical accounts
- Process descriptions
- Development over time

**Diagram:**
```
Day 1 → Day 2 → Day 3 → Day 4 → Day 5
(or)
2010 → 2015 → 2020 → 2025
```

**Example Use Case:**
"How We Built the Product"
- Started with idea (2020)
- First prototype (2021)
- Beta launch (2022)
- Full release (2023)
- Today's state (2024)

**Strength:** Natural, easy to follow, creates narrative
**Weakness:** Can be predictable

---

### 3. Circular/Cyclical Structure

**Description:** Start in the middle of action, flash back to beginning, return to where you started.

**When to Use:**
- Want to hook readers immediately with dramatic moment
- Need to provide background context
- Have a journey or trip to describe
- Want to create momentum while providing necessary backstory

**Diagram:**
```
Start: Day 5 (action/drama)
    ↓
Flash back: Day 1 (context/setup)
    ↓
Continue: Day 2, 3, 4 (build-up)
    ↓
Return: Day 5 (resolution)
    ↓
Conclusion: Day 6+ (aftermath)
```

**Example Use Case:**
"The Product Launch"
- Open with launch day crisis
- Flash back to how we got here
- Build toward launch day
- Return to crisis and resolution

**McPhee Example:**
Started narrative on day 5 of a trip, continued to day 9, then flashed back to day 1 (told in past tense), back to day 5.

**Strength:** Immediate engagement, maintains momentum while providing context
**Weakness:** Requires careful handling of time shifts

---

### 4. Dual Profile Structure

**Description:** Main subject in center, perspectives/aspects radiating outward.

**When to Use:**
- Character profiles
- Examining one topic from multiple angles
- Multiple perspectives on same subject
- Comprehensive view of complex person/thing

**Diagram:**
```
        Perspective A
              |
Perspective D - X - Perspective B
              |
        Perspective C

X = central subject (person, topic, idea)
A,B,C,D = different viewpoints or aspects
```

**Example Use Case:**
"Profile of a CEO"
- X = The CEO
- A = Employees' perspective
- B = Board members' view
- C = Customers' experience
- D = Competitors' assessment

**Strength:** Comprehensive, multi-dimensional view
**Weakness:** Can feel fragmented if not well-executed

---

### 5. Triple Profile Structure

**Description:** Three connected dual profiles sharing a common protagonist.

**When to Use:**
- Complex character interacting with multiple contexts
- Three distinct settings or situations
- Want to show range and depth

**Diagram:**
```
Profile 1         Profile 2         Profile 3
  (X-A)      ←→     (X-B)      ←→     (X-C)
    ↓                 ↓                 ↓
Common protagonist X throughout
```

**McPhee Example:**
"Encounters with the Archdruid" - three profiles featuring Dave Brouwer (climber, environmentalist) as common protagonist, with three different foils.

**Example Use Case:**
"A Day in Three Lives: The Remote Worker"
- Profile 1: Morning (worker-family interaction)
- Profile 2: Midday (worker-colleagues interaction)
- Profile 3: Evening (worker-client interaction)
- X (worker) is constant, contexts change

**Strength:** Shows subject in multiple dimensions
**Weakness:** Complex to execute, requires strong unifying thread

---

### 6. Pyramid Structure (Inverted Pyramid)

**Description:** Most important information first, descending order of importance.

**When to Use:**
- News writing
- Executive summaries
- Busy readers who might not finish
- Want to frontload key information

**Diagram:**
```
▼
████████████  Most important
  ██████████  Very important
    ████████  Important
      ██████  Supporting
        ████  Details
          ██  Background
```

**Example Use Case:**
"Quarterly Results Announcement"
- Lead: Revenue up 30%, profit doubled
- Key metrics and comparisons
- Contributing factors
- Market context
- Detailed breakdowns
- Historical comparisons

**Strength:** Ensures readers get key information even if they don't finish
**Weakness:** Can feel front-loaded, lacks narrative tension

---

### 7. Parallel Narratives

**Description:** Multiple storylines running simultaneously, interwoven.

**When to Use:**
- Comparing/contrasting
- Multiple threads that connect
- Want to show simultaneity
- Complex, multi-faceted topics

**Diagram:**
```
Thread A: ────•────•────•────•
Thread B: ──•────•────•────•──
Thread C: •────•────•────•────•

(Threads alternate or intersect)
```

**Example Use Case:**
"Three Teams Building the Same Product"
- Thread A: Silicon Valley startup
- Thread B: Corporate enterprise team
- Thread C: Open-source community
- Alternate between threads, showing parallel progress

**Strength:** Shows multiple perspectives, creates richness
**Weakness:** Can confuse readers if not clearly signaled

---

### 8. Other McPhee Diagrams

**Horizontal Line with Loops:**
```
────○────○────────○──○─────
    ↓    ↓        ↓  ↓
  tangent tangent tangent
```
Main storyline with tangents above and below representing digressions.

**Circle with Radiating Lines:**
```
      ↗  ↑  ↖
   →  ● ← (center point)
      ↙  ↓  ↘
```
Central moment with different narrative pathways shooting out.

**Custom Diagrams:**
McPhee creates completely idiosyncratic diagrams that "look like the late-stage wall sketches of a hermit stuck in a cave" - but they work for the specific piece.

## Creating Your Own Structure Diagram

### Step 1: Gather Your Material

Before diagramming:
- Research completely
- Take all notes
- Understand all aspects
- Know more than you'll use

**McPhee's principle:** You must know your material inside out before you can structure it.

### Step 2: Identify the Organizing Principle

Ask:
- What is this piece really about? (core idea)
- What's the natural order? (time, space, importance, causality)
- What does the reader need to know when?
- Where's the drama or tension?
- What's the through-line?

Common organizing principles:
- **Chronological:** When things happened
- **Spatial:** Where things are
- **Causal:** What led to what
- **Importance:** Most to least significant
- **Comparison:** Similarities and differences
- **Problem-solution:** Issue then resolution
- **Question-answer:** Inquiry then discovery

### Step 3: Sketch 3 Options

**Why 3?**
- Forces you to think beyond the obvious
- Lets you compare approaches
- Often the second or third option is best
- Shows you what doesn't work

**For each option:**
1. Draw the basic structure (list, circle, timeline, etc.)
2. Place your major points/moments
3. Map the flow/progression
4. Note transitions
5. Annotate with gold-coin placement (see below)

### Step 4: Test Each Structure

Ask:
- Does it serve the material naturally?
- Will readers follow easily?
- Does it create appropriate momentum?
- Are key moments well-placed?
- Does it feel inevitable or forced?

### Step 5: Select and Refine

Choose the structure that:
- Best serves the content
- Creates natural flow
- Places key moments strategically
- Feels right intuitively

Then refine:
- Adjust proportions (how much space for each section)
- Fine-tune transitions
- Map gold-coin placement
- Annotate key moments

## Gold-Coin Placement Strategy

Once you have your structure, map where you'll place rewards for readers.

### What Are Gold Coins?

Roy Peter Clark's metaphor: rewards that keep readers moving forward.

Gold coins include:
- Surprising facts
- Vivid anecdotes
- Good quotes
- Humor
- Beautiful metaphors
- Insights
- Examples
- Intriguing details

### Placement Strategy

**Beginning:** Open with a gold coin (hook readers)

**Middle:** Most important! Place gold coins throughout to combat the "saggy middle"

**End:** Strong gold coin for satisfying conclusion

**Avoid:** Front-loading all your best material in the opening

### Example Placement on Structure

```
List Structure with Gold Coins:

Introduction [Gold coin: surprising fact]
    ↓
Point 1 [Technique]
    ↓
Point 2 [Technique] [Gold coin: vivid example]
    ↓
Point 3 [Technique]
    ↓
Point 4 [Technique] [Gold coin: humor or insight]
    ↓
Point 5 [Technique]
    ↓
Conclusion [Gold coin: memorable anecdote]
```

Distribute evenly - don't cluster them all in one section.

## Structure Selection Criteria

### Match Structure to Material

| Material Type | Best Structure |
|--------------|----------------|
| Personal narrative | Chronological or Circular |
| Profile/character piece | Dual/Triple Profile |
| How-to guide | List |
| News/announcement | Pyramid |
| Complex multi-threaded story | Parallel Narratives |
| Journey/trip | Circular (start mid-journey) |
| Historical account | Chronological |
| Argument/persuasion | Problem-solution or Pyramid |
| Comparison piece | Parallel Narratives |

### Consider Your Readers

- **Busy readers:** Pyramid (frontload key info)
- **Engaged readers:** Circular or Parallel (build complexity)
- **Unfamiliar with topic:** Chronological (easy to follow)
- **Expert readers:** Dual/Triple Profile (sophisticated)

### Trust Your Instinct

After sketching options, one usually feels right. McPhee: "The structure that arises from the material" - you'll recognize it when you find it.

---

## Examples in Practice

### Example 1: Blog Post About Learning to Code

**Option A - Chronological:**
```
Day 1 → Week 1 → Month 1 → Month 3 → Month 6 → Today
```
Straightforward but predictable.

**Option B - Circular:**
```
Start: Today (deployed first app - success!)
    ↓
Flash back: Six months ago (why I started)
    ↓
Progress: The journey (struggles and wins)
    ↓
Return: Today (the deployment, lessons learned)
```
More engaging, starts with payoff.

**Option C - Dual Profile:**
```
         Me before coding
              |
      YouTube tutorials - ME - Bootcamp experience
              |
         Developer friends
```
Shows different aspects of learning.

**Selected:** Option B (Circular) - hooks with success, builds toward it, satisfying return.

### Example 2: Product Feature Comparison

**Option A - List:**
```
Feature 1: Ours vs. Theirs
Feature 2: Ours vs. Theirs
Feature 3: Ours vs. Theirs
```
Clear but mechanical.

**Option B - Parallel Narratives:**
```
User journey with our product: ─•──•──•──•─
User journey with their product: ──•──•──•──•
(Alternate sections)
```
Experiential, engaging.

**Option C - Pyramid:**
```
Most important differentiator
  Next important
    Supporting features
      Details
```
Efficient for busy readers.

**Selected:** Option B for marketing blog, Option C for executive brief.

## Working with Structure

### Before Drafting

1. **Complete your research/material gathering**
2. **Create 3 structure diagrams**
3. **Select the best one**
4. **Annotate with gold coins**
5. **Then start drafting**

McPhee: "I never start writing without a structure."

### During Drafting

- Refer to your diagram
- Follow the architecture
- Allow small deviations if they serve the piece
- But don't abandon structure entirely

### During Revision

- Check: Did you follow the structure?
- Assess: Does it still serve the piece?
- Adjust if needed (structure can evolve)
- Ensure transitions work smoothly

### Trust the Invisible Architecture

If structure is working:
- Readers won't notice it
- They'll just experience flow
- They'll feel the piece is "well-organized"
- They'll reach the end satisfied

If structure isn't working:
- Readers will feel lost
- They'll wonder "where is this going?"
- They'll experience it as disorganized
- They might abandon before the end

## Key Takeaways

1. **Blueprint before building** - always diagram before drafting
2. **Structure arises from material** - don't impose, discover
3. **Sketch 3 options** - first idea isn't always best
4. **Invisible but essential** - like bones, not seen but carrying everything
5. **Map gold coins** - place rewards strategically
6. **Trust your instinct** - you'll recognize the right structure
7. **Serve the content** - structure exists to support the material

McPhee's structural diagramming transforms writing from wandering to purposeful. It ensures every piece has an invisible architecture that carries readers from beginning to end with momentum, clarity, and satisfaction.
