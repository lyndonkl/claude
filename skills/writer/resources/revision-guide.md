## Workflow

**Before starting:**
- Review [Why Four Passes?](#why-four-passes) to understand the philosophy
- Review [Complete Four-Pass Example](#complete-four-pass-example) to see full transformation from draft to polished prose

Use this workflow when revising any draft. Work through all four passes sequentially:

**Pass 1: Cut Clutter** (see [Pass 1 details](#pass-1-cut-clutter-zinsserking))
- [ ] Identify all clutter: adverbs (-ly words), qualifiers (very, really, quite), passive voice, weak verbs (is, are, was, were)
- [ ] Remove adverbs - cut 70%
- [ ] Delete qualifiers (very, really, quite, rather, somewhat, fairly)
- [ ] Convert passive to active voice
- [ ] Replace weak verbs with action verbs
- [ ] Eliminate throat-clearing phrases
- [ ] Remove clichés
- [ ] Cut 10-25% of total word count
- [ ] Ensure every remaining word earns its place

See detailed examples and guidance in [Pass 1 section](#pass-1-cut-clutter-zinsserking).

**Pass 2: Reduce Cognitive Load** (see [Pass 2 details](#pass-2-reduce-cognitive-load-pinker))
- [ ] Identify and fix garden-path sentences
- [ ] Signal topic at start of each sentence
- [ ] Keep subject-verb-object close (max 7-word separation)
- [ ] Clarify all ambiguous pronouns
- [ ] Map topic chains for coherence
- [ ] Break overly complex sentences into simpler ones
- [ ] Read aloud - mark where you stumble
- [ ] Ensure first reading is correct reading

See detailed examples and guidance in [Pass 2 section](#pass-2-reduce-cognitive-load-pinker).

**Pass 3: Improve Rhythm** (see [Pass 3 details](#pass-3-improve-rhythm-clark))
- [ ] Analyze sentence length patterns - look for monotony
- [ ] Identify monotonous patterns (5+ similar-length sentences)
- [ ] Add short sentences for emphasis
- [ ] Check last word of each sentence - is it strong?
- [ ] Map gold-coin placement - are readers rewarded throughout?
- [ ] Use ladder of abstraction (concrete → general → concrete)
- [ ] Read aloud - does it flow?
- [ ] Assess variety: good mix of short, medium, and long sentences

See detailed examples and guidance in [Pass 3 section](#pass-3-improve-rhythm-clark).

**Pass 4: Enhance Message** (see [Pass 4 details](#pass-4-enhance-message-heath))
- [ ] Assess message against SUCCESs framework
- [ ] Score message on all 6 SUCCESs elements (Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories)
- [ ] Improve weak elements
- [ ] Core message is ≤12 words
- [ ] Added element of surprise or curiosity
- [ ] Concrete, visualizable details present
- [ ] Credibility established
- [ ] Emotional connection created
- [ ] Story or human element included
- [ ] Aim for strong score on 5-6 elements

See detailed examples and guidance in [Pass 4 section](#pass-4-enhance-message-heath).

## Why Four Passes?

Trying to fix everything at once overwhelms your critical faculties. Each pass has one focus, making the work manageable and more effective. Multiple focused passes produce better results than one comprehensive revision.

**The System:**
1. **Pass 1: Cut Clutter** (Zinsser/King) - Make it lean
2. **Pass 2: Reduce Cognitive Load** (Pinker) - Make it readable
3. **Pass 3: Improve Rhythm** (Clark) - Make it flow
4. **Pass 4: Enhance Message** (Heath) - Make it stick

---

## Pass 1: Cut Clutter (Zinsser/King)

### Goal

Cut 10-25% of the word count. King's formula: **2nd draft = 1st draft - 10-25%**

This forces you to tighten sentences, remove tangents, and strengthen what remains.

### What to Cut

#### 1. Adverbs (-ly words)

**Before:** "He walked very slowly across the room."
**After:** "He shuffled across the room."
**Analysis:** "Shuffled" conveys slow walking more precisely than "walked very slowly."

**Before:** "The data clearly shows that..."
**After:** "The data shows that..."
**Analysis:** If the data shows it, it's already clear. "Clearly" adds nothing.

**Before:** "She was extremely tired after the race."
**After:** "She was exhausted after the race."
**Analysis:** "Exhausted" is stronger than "extremely tired."

#### 2. Qualifiers

**Before:** "This is somewhat concerning for our project."
**After:** "This is concerning for our project."
**Analysis:** Either it's concerning or it isn't. "Somewhat" hedges unnecessarily.

**Before:** "The results were quite impressive."
**After:** "The results were impressive."
**Analysis:** "Quite" dilutes impact.

**Qualifier words to eliminate:**
- very, really, quite, rather, somewhat, fairly
- kind of, sort of, type of
- just, actually, basically, essentially

#### 3. Passive Voice

**Before:** "The report was written by the committee."
**After:** "The committee wrote the report."
**Analysis:** Active voice is direct and clear. Actors act.

**Before:** "Mistakes were made in the analysis."
**After:** "We made mistakes in the analysis."
**Analysis:** Passive voice obscures responsibility. Active voice is honest.

**Before:** "The system is being upgraded by our team."
**After:** "Our team is upgrading the system."
**Analysis:** Active voice creates energy and clarity.

#### 4. Weak Verbs

**Before:** "There are three reasons why this is important."
**After:** "Three reasons make this important."
**Analysis:** "Are" is weak. Find the real verb.

**Before:** "The storm had an impact on our schedule."
**After:** "The storm delayed our schedule."
**Analysis:** "Had an impact on" is bureaucratic. "Delayed" is direct.

**Before:** "We will make a decision about the proposal."
**After:** "We will decide about the proposal."
**Analysis:** "Make a decision" → "decide"

#### 5. Throat-Clearing

**Before:** "It should be noted that there are several factors to consider in this situation."
**After:** "We must consider several factors."
**Analysis:** Cut the wind-up, get to the point.

**Before:** "In my personal opinion, I believe that..."
**After:** "I believe that..."
**Analysis:** All opinions are personal. All beliefs are "I believe."

**Before:** "At this point in time, we are currently experiencing..."
**After:** "We are experiencing..."
**Analysis:** "At this point in time" and "currently" both mean "now."

### Complete Example: Pass 1

**Before (86 words):**
"In my opinion, the project that we have been working on is extremely important and really deserves to be given our full attention. There are several factors that need to be very carefully considered. The budget was exceeded by nearly 20%, which is quite concerning. Actually, this kind of overrun has been seen before in similar projects. It is basically essential that we really focus on getting things back on track as quickly as possible."

**After (44 words - 49% reduction):**
"This project is important and deserves our full attention. We must consider several factors. The budget exceeded 20% - concerning. Similar projects show this pattern. We must get back on track quickly."

**What Changed:**
- Removed: "In my opinion," "that we have been working on," "extremely," "really," "kind of," "basically," "actually," "as quickly as possible"
- Changed passive to active: "was exceeded by" → "exceeded"
- Replaced weak constructions: "There are several factors that need to be considered" → "We must consider several factors"
- Simplified: "essential that we really focus on getting things" → "must get"

---

## Pass 2: Reduce Cognitive Load (Pinker)

### Goal

Make reading effortless. Reduce the mental work required to parse your sentences. Eliminate temporary ambiguities and improve coherence.

### Techniques

#### 1. Fix Garden-Path Sentences

Garden-path sentences temporarily mislead readers, forcing them to backtrack and reparse.

**Garden-path:** "The horse raced past the barn fell."
**Clear:** "The horse that was raced past the barn fell."
**Better:** "The horse fell after being raced past the barn."
**Analysis:** First version tricks readers into parsing "raced" as the main verb, forcing reparse when they hit "fell."

**Garden-path:** "When Mary started to clean the kitchen smelled wonderful."
**Clear:** "The kitchen smelled wonderful when Mary started to clean."
**Analysis:** First version makes readers think Mary is cleaning the kitchen, then forces reinterpretation when they hit "smelled."

**Garden-path:** "The students who the teacher had criticized harshly filed complaints."
**Clear:** "The students filed complaints. The teacher had criticized them harshly."
**Analysis:** Simplified to two sentences - easier to process.

#### 2. Signal Topic Early

Lead with what the sentence is about. Don't bury the topic.

**Buried topic:** "In the report that was submitted yesterday by the research team, several critical issues were identified."
**Topic early:** "The research team identified several critical issues in yesterday's report."
**Analysis:** "Research team" is the topic - lead with it.

**Buried topic:** "Among the many factors contributing to the project's success, effective communication stands out."
**Topic early:** "Effective communication contributed most to the project's success."
**Analysis:** Get to "effective communication" immediately.

#### 3. Keep Subject-Verb-Object Close

Don't insert long clauses between key sentence elements.

**Distant:** "The report that the committee spent three months preparing based on extensive research and stakeholder feedback finally arrived yesterday."
**Close:** "The report finally arrived yesterday. The committee spent three months preparing it, basing it on extensive research and stakeholder feedback."
**Analysis:** Breaking into two sentences keeps elements close.

**Distant:** "The developer who had been working on the feature for weeks despite numerous setbacks completed it."
**Close:** "The developer completed the feature. She had worked on it for weeks despite setbacks."
**Analysis:** Subject-verb separation causes cognitive load.

#### 4. Ensure Pronoun Clarity

Make sure every pronoun has one clear antecedent.

**Ambiguous:** "John told Mark that he needed to revise his proposal."
**Clear:** "John told Mark, 'You need to revise your proposal.'"
**Or:** "John told Mark to revise the proposal."
**Analysis:** "He" and "his" could refer to either John or Mark.

**Ambiguous:** "The team reviewed the code and the documentation. It had several errors."
**Clear:** "The team reviewed the code and the documentation. The code had several errors."
**Analysis:** "It" is ambiguous - what had errors?

#### 5. Map Topic Chains

Ensure each sentence connects to the previous one. Readers follow topics through a piece.

**Broken chain:**
"Mozart was a prolific composer. Austria produced many famous musicians. The classical period saw great innovation."

**Coherent chain:**
"Mozart was a prolific composer. His works span every genre of his time. The operas, particularly, show his genius."

**Analysis:** Second version maintains topic: Mozart → His works → The operas

### Complete Example: Pass 2

**Before (after Pass 1):**
"This project is important and deserves our full attention. We must consider several factors. The budget exceeded 20% - concerning. Similar projects show this pattern. We must get back on track quickly."

**After Pass 2 (improved readability):**
"This project deserves our full attention. Three factors require consideration: budget, timeline, and quality. Our budget exceeded 20% - a concerning pattern shown in similar projects. We must get back on track."

**What Changed:**
- Topic signaling: Made each sentence topic clear
- Concrete details: "Three factors" more specific than "several"
- Coherence: Connected "budget" across sentences
- Combined last two sentences for better flow

---

## Pass 3: Improve Rhythm (Clark)

### Goal

Create engaging flow through sentence variety. Add gold-coin moments. End sentences with strong words.

### Techniques

#### 1. Vary Sentence Length

Monotonous rhythm disengages readers. Mix short, medium, and long sentences.

**Monotonous (all ~15 words):**
"The team completed the project on schedule. The results exceeded our expectations significantly. We learned valuable lessons from the experience. Our clients expressed satisfaction with the outcome."

**Varied:**
"The team completed the project on schedule. The results exceeded our expectations. We learned valuable lessons - about collaboration, about time management, about quality. Our clients were delighted."

**Analysis:** Added a very short sentence ("The results exceeded our expectations"), a longer complex sentence, and ended with impact.

#### 2. Power of the Short Sentence

After several longer sentences, a short one creates emphasis.

**Example:**
"We reviewed the data carefully, analyzing trends over the past five years and comparing our performance to industry benchmarks. We consulted experts. We ran simulations. The conclusion was inescapable: we needed to pivot our strategy immediately."

**Analysis:** "We consulted experts. We ran simulations." - short sentences build momentum toward the conclusion.

#### 3. End Sentences with Strong Words

The last word carries weight.

**Weak ending:** "This is something we should think about carefully."
**Strong ending:** "This demands careful thought."
**Analysis:** Ends with the noun "thought" (strong) vs. adverb "carefully" (weak).

**Weak ending:** "The storm was approaching rapidly."
**Strong ending:** "The storm approached."
**Analysis:** "Approached" is stronger than "rapidly."

**Weak ending:** "Revenue increased significantly last quarter."
**Strong ending:** "Last quarter, revenue soared."
**Analysis:** "Soared" is more vivid than "increased significantly."

#### 4. Gold-Coin Moments

Place rewards throughout to keep readers engaged.

**Gold coins include:**
- Surprising facts
- Good quotes
- Vivid examples
- Humor
- Beautiful metaphors
- Fresh insights
- Anecdotes
- Intriguing details

**Strategy:** Don't front-load all your best material. Distribute it evenly, especially in the middle section.

**Example:**
Instead of: [All good examples in opening paragraph]
Better: Opening example → mid-section surprising fact → closing anecdote

#### 5. Ladder of Abstraction

Move between concrete and general: concrete → general → concrete

**Example:**
"She drove a battered 2015 Subaru Outback [concrete], one of those reliable station wagons that just keep going [general]. Her particular car had 180,000 miles and a dent in the rear bumper shaped like Texas [concrete]."

### Complete Example: Pass 3

**Before (after Pass 2):**
"This project deserves our full attention. Three factors require consideration: budget, timeline, and quality. Our budget exceeded 20% - a concerning pattern shown in similar projects. We must get back on track."

**After Pass 3 (improved rhythm):**
"This project deserves our full attention. Why? Three factors: budget, timeline, and quality. Our budget exceeded 20%. Similar projects show this pattern. The Acme redesign? Over budget. The Phoenix rollout? Same story. We must get back on track immediately."

**What Changed:**
- Added very short sentence: "Why?"
- Added concrete examples (gold coins): "Acme redesign" and "Phoenix rollout"
- Varied sentence length deliberately
- Ended with strong word: "immediately"
- Created rhythm: medium, short, medium, short, short, short, medium

## Pass 4: Enhance Message (Heath)

### Goal

Make your message stick in readers' memories using the SUCCESs model.

### The SUCCESs Checklist

#### S - Simple
- [ ] Core message in ≤12 words
- [ ] One main idea, not many
- [ ] Proverb-like simplicity

**Example:**
Before: "Our strategic initiative focuses on leveraging synergies between departments to optimize resource utilization and enhance stakeholder value."
After: "Work together. Share resources. Deliver value."

#### U - Unexpected
- [ ] Violate readers' expectations
- [ ] Create curiosity gap
- [ ] Surprise early

**Example:**
Boring: "Project budgets often exceed estimates."
Unexpected: "Your project will fail. Not might fail - will fail. Unless you do three things..."

#### C - Concrete
- [ ] Sensory details
- [ ] Specific examples
- [ ] Visualizable

**Example:**
Abstract: "The project had quality issues."
Concrete: "The dashboard crashed every morning at 9 AM when 200+ users logged in simultaneously."

#### C - Credible
- [ ] Statistics (human-scale)
- [ ] Testability ("try it yourself")
- [ ] Authority or anti-authority
- [ ] Vivid details that ring true

**Example:**
Vague: "Many users experienced problems."
Credible: "73% of users (847 out of 1,162) reported login failures between May 1-15."

#### E - Emotional
- [ ] Focus on individuals, not masses
- [ ] Appeal to identity
- [ ] Self-interest or values
- [ ] Make them care

**Example:**
Distant: "Budget overruns affect project outcomes."
Emotional: "Your team worked nights and weekends. Your effort deserves a project that succeeds."

#### S - Stories
- [ ] Specific narrative
- [ ] Challenge, Connection, or Creativity plot
- [ ] Mental simulation
- [ ] Human element

**Example:**
Statement: "Code reviews improve quality."
Story: "Sarah caught a critical bug in code review - a null pointer that would have crashed the app in production. 50,000 users avoided downtime because Sarah took ten minutes to review carefully."

### Complete Example: Pass 4

**Before (after Pass 3):**
"This project deserves our full attention. Why? Three factors: budget, timeline, and quality. Our budget exceeded 20%. Similar projects show this pattern. The Acme redesign? Over budget. The Phoenix rollout? Same story. We must get back on track immediately."

**After Pass 4 (enhanced stickiness):**
"This project deserves your full attention [Emotional - "your"]. Why? Last year, we spent $240,000 over budget on projects exactly like this one [Concrete]. The Acme redesign? 30% over. The Phoenix rollout? 25% over [Concrete + Credible]. Here's what's different this time [Unexpected - curiosity gap]: we're using zero-based budgeting. Every dollar must be justified every week [Simple]. Sarah's team tested this on the Alpha project - they came in 5% under budget [Story + Credible]. We can do this [Emotional]."

**What Changed:**
- Simple: Clear core message
- Unexpected: "Here's what's different" creates curiosity
- Concrete: Specific dollar amounts ($240,000), specific percentages (30%, 25%, 5%)
- Credible: Real projects, testable approach
- Emotional: "Your" attention, "We can do this"
- Story: Sarah's team success

**SUCCESs Score: 6/6**

## Complete Four-Pass Example

**Original (250 words):**
"It has come to our attention that there are several significant issues that need to be addressed regarding the software development project that our team has been working on for the past several months. The project timeline has been considerably extended beyond what was originally planned, and we are currently experiencing budget overruns that are quite substantial and concerning. In my personal opinion, based on my experience with similar projects, I really think that we need to very carefully reconsider our approach and make some important changes to how we're managing things going forward. There are basically three main areas where improvements could potentially be made. First of all, the communication between the various teams involved in the project has been somewhat lacking and could definitely be improved significantly. Secondly, the scope of the project seems to have expanded quite a bit from what was initially agreed upon, which has obviously had an impact on both our timeline and our budget. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly in my view, we haven't been doing a very good job of tracking our progress and identifying problems early enough to actually do something about them before they become major issues. If we want to successfully complete this project and deliver results that meet our stakeholders' expectations, we really need to take immediate action to address these concerns and get things back on track."

**After Pass 1 - Cut Clutter (155 words, 38% reduction):**
"Several significant issues need attention regarding our software development project. The timeline extended beyond our plan, and budget overruns are substantial. We must reconsider our approach and change how we manage the project. Three areas need improvement. First, communication between teams is lacking. Second, scope expanded from our initial agreement, impacting timeline and budget. Third, we haven't tracked progress effectively or identified problems early. We need to complete this project successfully and deliver results that meet stakeholder expectations. We must take immediate action."

**After Pass 2 - Reduce Cognitive Load (145 words):**
"Our software development project faces significant issues. The timeline extended beyond plan. Budget overruns are substantial. We must change our approach. Three areas need improvement. First, team communication is lacking. Teams don't share updates or coordinate effectively. Second, scope expanded from our initial agreement. New features keep appearing. Third, we fail to track progress. Problems grow until they're crises. Our stakeholders expect results. We must act now. How? Three steps: establish daily standups, freeze scope immediately, and implement weekly progress tracking. Other teams tried this. The Phoenix project recovered using these exact steps. They delivered on time and 5% under budget. We can too."

**After Pass 3 - Improve Rhythm (142 words):**
"Our software development project is failing. The timeline? Blown. The budget? 30% over. We must change our approach. Why? Three problems. First, teams don't communicate. Updates are rare. Coordination is nonexistent. Second, scope keeps expanding. New features appear weekly. No one says no. Third, we don't track progress. Small problems become crises. How do we fix this? Three steps: daily standups, frozen scope, and weekly tracking. Sound simple? It is. Sound effective? Ask the Phoenix team. They faced the same problems last year - 25% over budget, three months late. They implemented these three steps. Result? Delivered on time, 5% under budget. We can do this."

**After Pass 4 - Enhance Message (138 words):**
"Your project is failing [Unexpected]. The timeline? Blown. The budget? $180,000 over [Concrete]. Your team deserves better [Emotional]. Three problems are killing us [Simple]: teams don't communicate [Concrete - updates are rare, coordination is nonexistent], scope keeps expanding [Concrete - new features appear weekly, no one says no], and we don't track progress [Concrete - small problems become crises]. Here's the good news [Unexpected]: three steps fix this [Simple]. Daily standups. Frozen scope. Weekly tracking. Ask Sarah from the Phoenix team [Story]. Last year, her project was in identical trouble - 25% over budget, three months late [Credible]. She implemented these three steps [Simple]. Her result? On time, 5% under budget [Credible]. Your team can do this [Emotional]."

**Summary:**
- Words: 250 → 138 (45% reduction)
- Reading ease: Improved significantly
- Sentence variety: Added short punchy sentences
- Stickiness: All 6 SUCCESs elements present
- Impact: Message is now clear, concrete, and memorable
