## John McPhee: Structural Architecture

### Philosophy

"Structure is as invisible as someone's bones" - readers shouldn't notice it, but it carries everything. Structure must arise from within the material, not be imposed upon it.

### Origin

Learned from high school English teacher Mrs. McKee, who required structural outlines before drafting. Could be "anything from Roman numerals I, II, III to a looping doodle with guiding arrows and stick figures."

### Method

1. **Blueprint before drafting** - Never write without structure
2. **Multiple options** - Sketch 3 different structures, select best
3. **Invisible to readers** - They experience flow, not structure
4. **Serves the material** - Structure emerges from content

### Key Structure Types

**Dual Profile Structure:**
- X in center = main subject
- Dots around edge = different perspectives on subject
- Used for character profiles, complex topics

**Triple Profile Structure:**
- Three connected profiles with common protagonist
- Example: "Encounters with the Archdruid" about Dave Brouwer

**Circular/Cyclical Structure:**
- Start on day 5 of a journey
- Continue to day 9
- Flash back to day 1 (in past tense)
- Return to day 5
- Maintains momentum while providing context

**Other Diagrams:**
- Horizontal line with loops = tangents along storyline
- Circle with shooting lines = narrative pathways
- Custom diagrams for unique pieces

### Application

Before drafting:
1. Understand your material completely
2. Identify the natural organizing principle
3. Sketch 3 different structural options
4. Select the one that best serves the content
5. Annotate with key moments and transitions

## William Zinsser: Clarity and Simplicity

### Philosophy

"Clarity over ornament." Simplicity reveals meaning. Clutter is the enemy of clear writing. Every word must earn its place.

### Core Principle

Strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Remove words that serve no function. Prefer the simple to the complex, the concrete to the abstract.

### Clarity Toolkit

**Kill Adverbs:**
- "very important" → "important" or "critical"
- "really quickly" → "quickly" or "rapidly"
- "extremely difficult" → "difficult" or "arduous"
- Most -ly words weaken rather than strengthen

**Remove Qualifiers:**
- "somewhat concerned" → "concerned"
- "rather interesting" → "interesting"
- "quite good" → "good"
- "pretty sure" → "sure"
- Very, really, quite, rather, somewhat, fairly - delete them

**Eliminate Bureaucratese:**
- "at this point in time" → "now"
- "in the event that" → "if"
- "due to the fact that" → "because"
- "has the ability to" → "can"

**Prefer Anglo-Saxon over Latinate:**
- "utilize" → "use"
- "commence" → "start"
- "terminate" → "end"
- "facilitate" → "help"
- Simpler words, clearer meaning

**Concrete over Abstract:**
- "precipitation" → "rain"
- "accommodation" → "room" or "apartment"
- "transportation" → "car," "bus," "train"
- "implement a solution" → "solve the problem"

### Clutter Words to Eliminate

- Just, actually, basically, essentially, totally
- Kind of, sort of, type of
- In order to (use "to")
- On a daily basis (use "daily")
- Personal opinion (all opinions are personal)

### Examples

**Before:** "The reason why we are actually implementing this particular solution at this point in time is due to the fact that it has the capability to quite effectively address the issues we are currently experiencing."

**After:** "We're implementing this solution now because it effectively addresses our current issues."

**Analysis:** Cut from 36 words to 13 words (64% reduction) while improving clarity.

## Stephen King: Disciplined Process

### Philosophy

"Volume builds instinct." Write every day. First draft is for discovery, second draft is where real writing happens. Cut ruthlessly.

### Drafting Approach

**Write with Door Closed:**
- First draft is just for you
- No one sees it, so be fearless
- Write fast, don't edit while drafting
- Discovery through volume

**Favor Concrete Nouns and Strong Verbs:**
- Not: "The sound of the door was loud"
- Better: "The door slammed"
- Not: "He walked slowly"
- Better: "He shuffled" or "He trudged"

**Sensory Grounding:**
- What does it look like?
- What does it sound like?
- What does it smell like?
- What does it feel like?
- Ground readers in physical reality

### Revision Formula

**2nd Draft = 1st Draft - 10-25%**

This is not arbitrary - it forces you to:
- Cut unnecessary words
- Tighten sentences
- Remove tangents
- Strengthen what remains

### How to Cut Effectively

1. **First pass:** Remove obvious clutter
2. **Second pass:** Cut weak paragraphs
3. **Third pass:** Tighten sentences
4. **Fourth pass:** Remove anything that doesn't serve the piece

### Write with Door Open

Second draft is for readers. Now you think about:
- Will they understand this?
- Is this clear?
- Does this serve the story/message?
- What can I cut?

### Daily Practice

Write every day, even if just for 20 minutes. The muscle strengthens with use. Volume builds instinct - you learn what works by doing it repeatedly.

## Anne Lamott: Creative Psychology

### Philosophy

"Mess first, refine later." Perfectionism kills creativity. Shitty first drafts are how good writing begins. Be kind to yourself in the creative process.

### The Shitty First Draft

**Why it works:**
- Removes pressure to be perfect
- Allows discovery
- Frees you to experiment
- Gets words on paper (you can't edit a blank page)

**How to do it:**
- Write fast
- Don't judge
- Let it be terrible
- No one will see this version
- Discovery happens in the mess

### Door Closed vs. Door Open

**Door Closed (Drafting):**
- Write for yourself
- No judgment
- Explore and discover
- Volume over quality

**Door Open (Revision):**
- Write for readers
- Critical eye engaged
- Polish and refine
- Quality through cutting

### Creative Compassion

**Be kind to yourself:**
- All first drafts are terrible (even from professionals)
- Writing is hard - that's normal
- Progress over perfection
- Celebrate small wins

**Trust the process:**
- Mess → clarity
- Volume → instinct
- Practice → improvement
- Drafts → polish

### Practical Application

1. Set micro-goals (write for 20 minutes, or 500 words)
2. Don't edit while drafting
3. Embrace the mess
4. Revise when you're done drafting
5. Be patient with yourself

## Steven Pinker: Reader Cognition

### Philosophy

"Read the reader's mind." Anticipate parsing load, memory span, and expectations. Make reading effortless by understanding how readers process sentences.

### Garden-Path Sentences

**Definition:** Sentences that lure readers into one interpretation, then force them to backtrack and reparse.

**Example:** "The horse raced past the barn fell."
- First reading: "The horse raced past the barn" (seems complete)
- Forced reinterpretation: "The horse [that was] raced past the barn fell"
- Cognitive cost: reader must backtrack and reparse

**Real-world example:** "A faculty panel on sex in college with four professors"
- Misleading: sounds like sex WITH four professors
- Intended: panel BY four professors ABOUT sex in college

**How to avoid:**
- Signal topic early
- Avoid temporary ambiguities
- Rewrite if first reading misleads

### Core Principles

**Signal Topic Early:**
- Don't bury the lede at sentence level
- Lead with what the sentence is about
- Orient reader immediately

**Example:**
- Garden-path: "When Mary started to clean the kitchen smelled wonderful."
- Clear: "The kitchen smelled wonderful when Mary started to clean."

**Keep Subject-Verb-Object Close:**
- Minimize distance between key elements
- Don't insert long clauses between subject and verb
- Reduce working memory load

**Example:**
- Difficult: "The report that the committee spent three months preparing based on extensive research finally arrived."
- Better: "The report finally arrived. The committee spent three months preparing it based on extensive research."

**Map Coherence via Topic Chains:**
- Each sentence connects to previous
- Topic flows logically
- Reader can follow without effort

**Example coherent chain:**
- "Mozart was a prolific composer. His works span every genre of his time. The operas, particularly, show his genius."
- Topic chain: Mozart → His works → The operas

**Manage Cognitive Load:**
- Complex syntax = high cognitive load
- Simple syntax = low cognitive load
- Break up complex ideas into simpler sentences

**Pronoun Clarity:**
- Make sure pronouns have clear antecedents
- Don't use "it" or "they" if ambiguous
- Repeat the noun if needed for clarity

### Practical Application

1. Read your work aloud - where do you stumble?
2. Check for garden paths - does first reading mislead?
3. Keep subject-verb-object close together
4. Signal topic at start of sentence
5. Map your topic chains - do they flow?
6. Count distance between subject and verb - shorten if needed

## Roy Peter Clark: Newsroom Tools

### Philosophy

"Tools not rules." Writing is a craft with learnable techniques. Apply newsroom heuristics flexibly based on what the piece needs.

### Gold-Coin Moments

**The Metaphor:**
You're walking on a forest path. You see a gold coin shining ahead. You pick it up and move forward quickly, searching for more. You keep finding them, and you keep moving until the gold runs out.

**The Technique:**
Place rewards throughout your piece to keep readers engaged and moving forward.

**What Counts as Gold Coins:**
- Anecdotes
- Surprising facts
- Good quotes
- Humor
- Beautiful metaphors
- Fresh turns of phrase
- Intriguing characters
- Insights
- Examples

**Strategy:**
- Avoid front-loading all good material
- Distribute gold coins throughout
- Pay special attention to the middle (combat saggy middle)
- Reward readers for continuing

### Ladder of Abstraction

Move fluidly between concrete and general:
- **Concrete:** "The 2015 Subaru Outback"
- **Mid-level:** "Station wagon"
- **General:** "Vehicle"
- **Abstract:** "Transportation"

**Pattern:** Concrete → General → Concrete

**Example:**
"He drove a battered 2015 Subaru Outback, one of those reliable station wagons that just keep going. His particular car had 180,000 miles on it."

### Vary Sentence Length

**Monotony kills engagement:**
- Five 18-word sentences in a row = boring rhythm
- Mix it up deliberately

**Patterns:**
- Long sentence. Short. Medium sentence for flow. Very short.
- Short. Medium with some complexity here. Long sentence that unfolds gradually with multiple clauses that build on each other.

**The power of the short sentence:**
After several longer sentences, a short one has impact. It stops the reader. Creates emphasis.

### End Sentences with Strong Words

The last word carries weight. Make it count.

**Weak:** "This is something we should think about carefully."
**Strong:** "This demands careful thought."

**Weak:** "The storm was approaching rapidly."
**Strong:** "The storm approached."

### Newsroom Rules of Thumb

1. **Nut graf in first 5-7 sentences** - tell readers why they should care
2. **Frontload key information** - don't bury the lede
3. **Use active voice** - actors act
4. **One idea per paragraph** - white space aids comprehension
5. **Quote real people** - brings pieces alive

## Verlyn Klinkenborg: Sentence as Thought

### Philosophy

"Sentence is the thought." Each sentence should contain one clear idea. All writing is revision. See clearly, write what you see.

### Core Maxims

1. **All writing is revision** - First draft is discovery, writing happens in rewriting
2. **Good writing is one strong sentence after another** - Not paragraphs, not sections - sentences
3. **One sentence = one thought** - Don't compound multiple ideas

### One Sentence = One Thought

**Weak (multiple thoughts):**
"The project was challenging and required extensive research, but the team collaborated effectively, and we learned valuable lessons about time management while also discovering new methodologies."

**Strong (separate thoughts):**
"The project was challenging. It required extensive research. The team collaborated effectively. We learned valuable lessons about time management. We also discovered new methodologies."

### Eliminate Transitional Clutter

Trust readers to make connections. Don't over-signal.

**Cluttered:**
"Furthermore, it should be noted that in addition to the aforementioned points, we must also consider..."

**Clean:**
"We must consider..."

### Don't Save Your Point for the End

Front-load meaning. Be direct.

**Weak:** "Given the extensive research and analysis we conducted, combined with feedback from stakeholders and review of historical data, we recommend approval."

**Strong:** "We recommend approval. Our research, stakeholder feedback, and historical data all support this decision."

### Revise by Deleting

Cutting is the primary revision tool:
- Remove what doesn't contribute
- Trust in brevity
- Every word must earn its place

### Read Aloud for Cadence

The ear knows what works:
- Where do you stumble?
- Where does it flow?
- Where does it sound awkward?
- Trust your ear

### Replace Placeholder Sentences

**Placeholder:** "There are several important factors to consider."
**Actual content:** "We must consider cost, timeline, and quality."

**Placeholder:** "This is an interesting development."
**Actual content:** "This changes our strategy entirely."

Identify sentences that don't move the piece forward. Replace them with sentences that do.

### Practical Exercises

1. **Write 12 consecutive short sentences** describing a scene. Feel the rhythm.
2. **Take a paragraph, remove all conjunctions and transitions.** See what's left.
3. **Read your work aloud.** Mark every place you stumble.
4. **Circle every "to be" verb** (is, are, was, were). Replace 50% with action verbs.

## Chip & Dan Heath: Sticky Messages

### Philosophy

"Stickiness is design." Memorable messages aren't accidents - they follow patterns. Apply the SUCCESs model systematically.

### The SUCCESs Model

Six principles that make ideas stick:
- **S**imple
- **U**nexpected
- **C**oncrete
- **C**redible
- **E**motional
- **S**tories

### Simple

**Strip to essence:**
- Find the core
- One-sentence statements
- Proverbs are ultimate simplicity

**Example:** The Golden Rule - "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you." A lifetime of learning in twelve words.

**How to apply:**
- What's the single most important thing?
- If they remember only one thing, what should it be?
- Can you say it in 12 words?

### Unexpected

**Get and keep attention:**
- **Get attention:** Surprise (violate expectations)
- **Keep attention:** Interest (curiosity gaps)

**Schema violation:**
- "A faculty panel on sex" (wait, what?)
- "Movie theater popcorn has more fat than a bacon-and-eggs breakfast, Big Mac and fries, and steak dinner combined" (shocking!)

**Curiosity gaps:**
- Open a loop, then close it
- Create questions readers want answered

### Concrete

**Sensory and tangible:**
- Abstract: "high quality"
- Concrete: "silk-smooth surface, no scratches"

**Make it visualizable:**
- Can readers picture it?
- Does it engage senses?
- Is it grounded in physical reality?

### Credible

**Make them believe:**
- Authority (experts, statistics)
- Anti-authority (personal experience)
- Testability ("try it yourself")
- Human-scale statistics (not billions, but relatable numbers)
- Sinatra Test: "If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere"

### Emotional

**Make them care:**
- Focus on individuals, not masses (Mother Teresa: "If I look at the mass, I will never act")
- Appeal to identity ("This is who you are")
- Appeal to self-interest ("Here's what's in it for you")
- Connect to values

### Stories

**Mental simulation:**
- Readers put themselves in protagonist's shoes
- They experience emotions
- They learn through narrative
- They develop skills vicariously

**Three plot types:**
- Challenge plot (overcoming obstacles)
- Connection plot (bridging gaps)
- Creativity plot (solving problems newly)

### Real-World Examples

**CSPI Movie Popcorn Campaign:**
- Concrete: "More artery-clogging fat than bacon-and-eggs, Big Mac, and steak dinner combined"
- Unexpected: Shocking comparison
- Credible: Specific measurements
- Result: Massive media coverage, industry change

**Save the Children:**
- Story: Individual child (not statistics)
- Concrete: Specific details about one person
- Emotional: Connection to one child
- Result: More donations than mass statistics

### Integration

The six principles work together:
- Simple core message
- Delivered with unexpected angle
- Made concrete with sensory details
- Built credible through specific evidence
- Made emotional through personal connection
- Wrapped in story that creates mental simulation
