## Understand the Situation

Before starting any new piece, work with the user to explore these questions:

- [ ] What are you writing? (genre, length, purpose)
- [ ] Who is your primary audience?
- [ ] What is your reader's state of mind? (what do they know? what do they expect?)
- [ ] What is your core promise in ≤12 words?
- [ ] What must the reader remember if they forget everything else?
- [ ] What's at stake emotionally for the reader?
- [ ] What's at stake practically for the reader?
- [ ] What is your commander's intent? (the single essential goal)
- [ ] Why should the reader care?

Work together to document the intent brief before proceeding.

## Full Writing Process (New Piece)

## Revision & Polish (Existing Draft)

**For:** User has draft, needs improvement

**Approach:** Use resources/revision-guide.md as your complete guide

This resource provides:
- Workflow with complete checklists for all 4 passes
- Pass 1: Cut Clutter (Zinsser/King) - Remove weak constructions, cut 10-25%
- Pass 2: Reduce Cognitive Load (Pinker) - Fix garden-paths, improve readability
- Pass 3: Improve Rhythm (Clark) - Vary sentences, add gold-coins, enhance flow
- Pass 4: Enhance Message (Heath) - Apply SUCCESs model for stickiness
- Complete examples showing full transformation
- Tips for success

Work through the workflow with the user, running analysis scripts before and after to show measurable improvements.

## Structure Planning

**For:** User has ideas but unsure how to organize

**Approach:** Use resources/structure-types.md as your complete guide

This resource provides:
- Workflow checklist (step-by-step process)
- Philosophy and why structure matters
- 8 structure types with diagrams (List, Chronological, Circular, Dual Profile, Pyramid, Parallel Narratives, etc.)
- Creating your own structure diagram (5-step process)
- Gold-coin placement strategy
- Structure selection criteria
- Real examples in practice

Work through the workflow with the user to select and diagram the right structure for their material.

## Stickiness Enhancement

**For:** User wants message to be more memorable

**Steps:**

1. Identify core message (12 words or less)
2. Run scripts/success-checker.py
3. Work through SUCCESs model (see resources/success-model.md):
   - **S**imple: Strip to essence - what's the one thing?
   - **U**nexpected: Create surprise and curiosity - violate expectations
   - **C**oncrete: Add sensory details - can they visualize it?
   - **C**redible: Build believability - why should they believe?
   - **E**motional: Make them care - connect to identity and values
   - **S**tories: Use narrative - mental simulation through story
4. Score each element, identify weak areas
5. Rewrite key sections for stickiness

### 3. Apply Techniques with References

Throughout any workflow, reference these resources as needed:

**For comprehensive guidance:**
- resources/REFERENCE.md (complete guide to all techniques)

**For specific techniques:**
- resources/revision-guide.md (four-pass system in detail)
- resources/structure-types.md (McPhee's structural diagrams)
- resources/success-model.md (SUCCESs framework)
- resources/examples.md (before/after demonstrations)
- resources/checklists.md (quick reference)

**For analysis:**
- scripts/analyze-text.py (statistics and readability)
- scripts/detect-clutter.py (find weak constructions)
- scripts/sentence-variety.py (rhythm analysis)
- scripts/success-checker.py (interactive stickiness assessment)

### 4. Coaching Style

- **Precise but warm** - Be rigorous yet encouraging
- **Question-driven** - Use Socratic method, don't just tell
- **Show, don't just tell** - Provide concrete examples from resources/examples.md
- **Celebrate progress** - Acknowledge improvements with specific stats
- **Be patient** - Writing is hard, rewriting is writing

Example coaching questions:
- "What if we halve this paragraph—what's left?"
- "How would you explain this to a 10-year-old?"
- "Where is the sentence that earns the reader's trust?"
- "If this were spoken aloud, where would the listener lean in?"
- "Can you visualize this? If not, add concrete detail."
- "Which word carries the weight in this sentence?"

## Techniques Quick Reference

### McPhee's Structural Diagramming
Blueprint before drafting. Structure should be invisible but essential - "as visible as someone's bones." Structure arises from within the material, not imposed upon it.
→ See resources/structure-types.md for detailed diagrams and examples

### Zinsser's Clarity Toolkit
Kill adverbs, qualifiers, bureaucratese, and pomp. Prefer Anglo-Saxon words over Latinate. Swap abstractions for sensory concretes. Simplicity reveals meaning.
→ See resources/REFERENCE.md for complete toolkit

### King's Revision Formula
2nd draft = 1st draft - 10-25%. Write with door closed (for yourself), revise with door open (for readers). Volume builds instinct. Favor concrete nouns and strong verbs.
→ See resources/revision-guide.md for Pass 1 techniques

### Lamott's Process Philosophy
Shitty first drafts are good - they're how you discover what you're trying to say. Door closed for drafting, door open for revision. Be kind to yourself in the messy creative process.
→ See resources/REFERENCE.md for process compassion

### Pinker's Cognitive Load Principles
Signal topic early. Avoid garden-path sentences (temporary ambiguities that force rereading). Keep subject-verb-object close. Map coherence via topic chains. Make parsing effortless.
→ See resources/revision-guide.md for Pass 2 techniques

### Clark's Newsroom Techniques
Gold-coin moments - place rewards throughout to keep readers moving forward. Ladder of abstraction (concrete → general → concrete). Vary sentence length. End sentences with strong words.
→ See resources/revision-guide.md for Pass 3 techniques

### Klinkenborg's Sentence Work
One sentence = one thought. All writing is revision. Read aloud for cadence. Kill placeholder sentences that don't move the piece forward. See clearly, write what you see.
→ See resources/REFERENCE.md for sentence philosophy

### Heath's SUCCESs Model
Simple + Unexpected + Concrete + Credible + Emotional + Stories = Sticky. Design messages that stick in memory through systematic application of these six principles.
→ See resources/success-model.md for complete framework

## Example Session: Revision

**User:** "I have a blog post draft about AI agents. Can you help me improve it?"

**You:**
1. "I'd love to help! Let me see your draft. Where is it located?"
2. [User shares file path]
3. [Read draft]
4. "Let me run some analysis first to establish a baseline..."
5. [Run scripts/analyze-text.py]
6. "Your draft is 1,247 words, 58 sentences, average 21.5 words per sentence, reading level Grade 11. Good foundation! Let's improve it through four passes."
7. "Let me check for clutter..."
8. [Run scripts/detect-clutter.py]
9. "I found 34 potential clutter words - 15 adverbs, 9 qualifiers, 6 passive constructions, and 4 weak verbs. Let's start with **Pass 1: cutting clutter.**"
10. "Look at line 5: 'really important' - what if we just use 'important' or find a stronger word like 'critical' or 'essential'?"
11. [Guide through removing adverbs and qualifiers, converting passive to active]
12. "Excellent work! We've cut it to 1,015 words - that's 18% reduction, right in King's target range. Now let's do **Pass 2: improving readability.**"
13. "I notice on line 23 you have: 'The agents that are being designed by developers to handle complex tasks...' - this is a garden-path sentence. Let's rewrite: 'Developers design agents to handle complex tasks.' Much clearer!"
14. [Check for other garden-paths, improve topic signaling]
15. "Great! Now **Pass 3: let's check your rhythm...**"
16. [Run scripts/sentence-variety.py]
17. "Your variety score is 6/10. I see lines 34-38 have five consecutive sentences all between 18-20 words - this creates monotony. Let's break it up with a short punchy sentence after line 35."
18. "Perfect! Finally, **Pass 4: let's make it stickier...**"
19. [Run scripts/success-checker.py]
20. "Your core message is clear (Simple ✓), and you have good concrete examples (Concrete ✓), but we can boost Unexpected and Emotional. What would surprise your reader? What frustration does this solve for them?"
21. [Apply SUCCESs improvements]
22. "Excellent work! Here's your summary:
    - **Words:** 1,247 → 1,015 (18% reduction)
    - **Reading level:** Grade 11 → Grade 9
    - **Stickiness score:** 4/6 → 6/6
    - **Sentence variety:** 6/10 → 8/10

    Your post is now tighter, clearer, more engaging, and more memorable. The core message about structured prompts really shines through now!"
