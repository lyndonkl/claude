## Evidence Collection

### Evidence Types

**Research/Technical Evidence:**

- Technical skills mastered
- Problems solved
- Discoveries made

**Intellectual Evidence:**
- Key questions asked
- Insights contributed
- Creative solutions proposed
- Critical analysis demonstrated
- Synthesis across fields

**Professional Evidence:**
- Mentorship of others
- Collaborations facilitated
- Leadership roles
- Service contributions
- Presentations given
- Awards received

**Character Evidence:**
- Response to challenges
- Work ethic demonstrated
- Integrity examples
- Growth over time

### Evidence Quality Hierarchy

**Strongest (use these):**
1. Specific outcomes with numbers ("published 5 papers, cited 200 times")
2. Direct observations ("I watched her solve X problem by...")
3. Comparative achievements ("only student in 10 years to...")
4. External validation ("invited to speak at Gordon Conference")

**Moderate (supplement with these):**
5. General observations ("consistently high quality work")
6. Skills mentioned ("strong technical skills")
7. Character assessments ("dedicated and hardworking")

**Weakest (avoid as standalone):**
8. Adjectives without evidence ("brilliant")

## Tone Calibration

### Matching Tone to Assessment

**For truly exceptional candidates (top 5%):**
- Use superlatives: "the best", "extraordinary", "unparalleled"
- Make direct comparisons to best you've seen
- Express genuine enthusiasm in word choice
- Predict exceptional future success

**For strong candidates (top 25%):**
- Use strong positives: "excellent", "outstanding", "impressive"
- Make favorable comparisons to peers
- Show clear enthusiasm
- Predict solid success

**For good candidates (top 50%):**
- Use good positives: "strong", "capable", "competent"
- Note strengths without extreme comparisons
- Show support without overstatement
- Predict adequate success

**For candidates you cannot strongly endorse:**
- Consider declining to write
- If you must write, be honest without being damaging
- Focus on actual strengths
- Avoid false enthusiasm (readers detect it)

### Cultural Calibration

**US Academic Letters:**
- Superlatives expected and common
- "Excellent" may read as merely adequate
- Strong enthusiasm is the norm
- Lukewarm language is damaging

**International Considerations:**
- Other cultures may use more restrained language
- Adjust if writing for international audiences
- When in doubt, err on side of US-style enthusiasm for US positions

### Tone Checklist

- [ ] Does enthusiasm level match actual assessment?
- [ ] Are superlatives earned and specific?
- [ ] Does the letter read as genuine advocacy?
- [ ] Would you be comfortable if the candidate read it?
- [ ] Is the tone consistent throughout?

## Addressing Weaknesses

### When to Address

**Address proactively when:**
- Gap is obvious and would raise questions
- You can reframe it positively
- Silence would seem like avoidance
- Candidate asked you to address it

**Avoid addressing when:**
- Weakness is minor and not relevant
- Bringing it up does more harm than good
- Others' letters can better address it
- You don't have context to explain it

### How to Address

**Technique 1: Acknowledge and reframe**
```
"While Jane's publication record during her PhD was modest [acknowledge],
this reflects her choice to pursue a high-risk project that ultimately
led to a breakthrough published in Nature [reframe]."
```

**Technique 2: Show growth**
```
"Early in his postdoc, John struggled with project management [acknowledge].
However, he recognized this and developed systems that transformed him into
one of the most organized members of our team [show growth]."
```

**Technique 3: Provide context**
```
"Her graduate training took six years [acknowledge], which reflects the
ambitious scope of her project and the challenges of working on a completely
new system [context]."
```

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ Ignore obvious gaps (seems like avoidance)
- ❌ Over-explain minor issues (draws attention)
- ❌ Make excuses (undermines credibility)
- ❌ Be dishonest about serious issues (harms your reputation)
- ❌ Be harsh (damages candidate unnecessarily)
