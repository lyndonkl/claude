Search Committee
Department of Biochemistry
University of Excellence
123 Academic Way
Anytown, ST 12345

Dear Members of the Search Committee:

I am writing to provide my strongest possible recommendation for Dr. Jane Smith
for the position of Assistant Professor in your department. As the Director of
the Center for Structural Biology at Research University, I have had the privilege
of mentoring Jane for the past four years as her postdoctoral advisor. I can state
without reservation that she is among the most talented young scientists I have
encountered in my 25-year career.

Jane's research accomplishments have been exceptional. She joined my lab to study
the structural basis of enzyme catalysis and quickly established herself as a
creative and rigorous scientist. Her work on protein X resulted in three high-impact
publications, including a first-author paper in Nature Structural Biology that has
already been cited over 150 times. Most impressively, she independently developed a
novel cryo-EM method that has revolutionized how we study enzyme dynamics, a
technique now used by multiple labs worldwide.

Beyond her technical expertise, Jane possesses outstanding intellectual qualities.
She has a remarkable ability to identify important questions and design elegant
experiments to address them. During our weekly meetings, she consistently offers
insights that reshape how I think about problems in the field. Her presentations at
international conferences are always clear, engaging, and generate significant
discussion. She has been invited to speak at Gordon Conferences and was recently
selected for an early-career talk at the ASBMB annual meeting.

Jane's professional qualities are equally impressive. She has mentored three graduate
students in my lab, all of whom have published papers under her guidance. Two have
gone on to competitive postdoctoral positions at Stanford and MIT. She organized our
department's seminar series for two years and has been instrumental in fostering a
collaborative atmosphere in our research center.

In my 25 years at Research University, I have trained 42 postdoctoral fellows. Jane
ranks #1 among all of them. She is the most creative, productive, and promising young
scientist I have had the privilege to mentor. I have absolutely no doubt she will
develop an outstanding independent research program and become a leader in our field.

I give Jane my highest and most enthusiastic recommendation without any reservation.
She would be an exceptional addition to your faculty. Please contact me at
director@research.edu or (555) 123-4567 if you wish to discuss her qualifications
further.

Sincerely,

[Signature]

Dr. John Director
Distinguished Professor and Director
