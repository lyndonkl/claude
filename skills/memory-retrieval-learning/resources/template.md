## Section Guidance

### 1. Learning Goals

**Setting Realistic Timelines:**
- **Shallow learning (basic familiarity)**: 20-40 hours total
- **Working knowledge (can apply with resources)**: 100-200 hours total
- **Proficiency (independent application)**: 500-1000 hours total
- **Expertise (teach others, handle edge cases)**: 5000-10000 hours total

**Daily Time Commitment:**
- Minimum effective: 15-20 minutes (for spaced repetition maintenance only)
- Sustainable: 30-90 minutes daily
- Intensive: 2-4 hours daily (exam prep mode)
- Maximum: 6 hours daily (diminishing returns beyond this)

**Success Criteria Examples:**
- Quantifiable: "Pass exam with 80%+", "Build 3 portfolio projects", "Converse for 30 min"
- Observable: "Demonstrate skill to manager", "Complete certification", "Read news article"
- Time-bound: "By [date]", "Within 12 weeks", "Before job starts"

### 2. Material Breakdown

**Chunking Principles:**
- Each chunk should be 30-90 minutes of initial learning
- Related concepts grouped together
- Prerequisites before advanced topics
- Manageable cognitive load per chunk

**Estimating Hours:**
- **Reading/Watching**: Actual content time × 1.5-2x (for note-taking, pause, rewind)
- **Practice**: 2-3x reading time (doing > reading)
- **Complex concepts**: Add 50-100% for struggle time
- **Total**: Sum all estimates × 1.5 for buffer

**Priority Levels:**
- **High**: Must-know for success criteria (60-70% of material)
- **Medium**: Important but not critical (20-30%)
- **Low**: Nice-to-have or rarely used (5-10%)

### 3. Spaced Repetition Schedule

**Standard Intervals** (for 70-80% retention target):
- Day 0: Initial learning
- Day 1: First review (retention ~50-60%)
- Day 3: Second review (retention ~70%)
- Day 7: Third review (retention ~75%)
- Day 14: Fourth review (retention ~80%)
- Day 30: Fifth review (retention ~85%)
- Day 60+: Maintenance reviews as needed

**Adjusting for Performance:**
- If retention >90%: Extend next interval (e.g., 3 days → 5 days)
- If retention 70-90%: Keep standard interval
- If retention 50-70%: Shorten next interval (e.g., 7 days → 4 days)
- If retention <50%: Relearn + restart cycle

**Interleaving Strategy:**
- Don't review all Unit 1, then all Unit 2, then all Unit 3
- Mix: Unit 1 problem, Unit 2 problem, Unit 3 problem, Unit 1 problem...
- Improves transfer and discrimination between similar concepts

---

## Chunking Strategies

**Conceptual Knowledge (theories, models, frameworks):**
- Chunk by: Core concept + 2-3 related ideas
- Size: 3-5 key concepts per chunk
- Example: "Bayesian reasoning" chunk includes prior, likelihood, posterior, updating

**Procedural Skills (how to do something):**
- Chunk by: Complete procedure or algorithm
- Size: 5-10 steps per chunk
- Example: "SQL JOIN query" chunk includes all JOIN types + when to use each

**Factual Memory (dates, names, vocabulary):**
- Chunk by: Theme or category
- Size: 10-20 items per chunk
- Example: "Spanish food vocabulary" chunk = 15 related food words

**Problem-Solving (applying knowledge):**
- Chunk by: Problem type + solution approach
- Size: 3-5 example problems per chunk
- Example: "Optimization problems" chunk = objective function + constraints + solution method

---

## Retrieval Techniques by Material Type

### Flashcards (Best for: Facts, Vocab, Definitions)

**Anki / Spaced Repetition Software:**
- Front: Question/prompt/word
- Back: Answer/definition/translation
- Use cloze deletions for multi-part facts
- Add images for visual memory
- Retire after 5+ successful recalls spaced over weeks

**Quality Flashcard Rules:**
- One concept per card (atomic)
- Clear, unambiguous questions
- Concise answers (not paragraphs)
- Include context if needed
- Regular card review and retirement

### Practice Problems (Best for: Math, Coding, Analysis)

**Worked Examples + Self-Solve:**
- Day 1: Study worked example, understand each step
- Day 2: Solve similar problem without looking
- Day 3: Solve variation with different numbers/context
- Day 7: Mixed practice with problems from multiple topics

**Progressive Difficulty:**
- Start with template/scaffold provided
- Gradually remove scaffolding
- Eventually solve from blank page
- Mix easy + hard problems in review sessions

### Self-Quizzing (Best for: Concepts, Understanding)

**Question Types:**
- Explain: "How does X work?"
- Compare: "What's the difference between X and Y?"
- Apply: "When would you use X vs Y?"
- Evaluate: "What are the pros/cons of X?"

**Self-Quiz Protocol:**
- Close notes, write answer from memory
- Check answer against source
- Note areas of struggle for extra review
- Rewrite answer correctly if wrong

### Teach-Back Method (Best for: Deep Understanding)

**Process:**
1. Learn the material
2. Explain it to someone else (or rubber duck)
3. Identify gaps in your explanation
4. Re-study those specific gaps
5. Explain again until fluent

**Benefits:**
- Forces organization of knowledge
- Reveals hidden misunderstandings
- Strengthens recall pathways
- Tests transfer ability

### Mock Tests / Simulations (Best for: Integration, Exam Prep)

**Scheduling:**
- First mock: After 30-40% of material learned
- Mid-point mock: At 60-70% completion
- Final mocks: Weekly in last month before exam
- Conditions: Timed, closed-book (match real test)

**Analysis After Each Mock:**
- Identify weak topics (< 60% correct)
- Categorize errors: Knowledge gap vs. careless mistake vs. time pressure
- Create focused review plan for weak areas
- Repeat mock in 1-2 weeks to measure improvement

## Tracking Methods

### Digital Tools

**Spaced Repetition Software (Anki, SuperMemo):**
- Automatic scheduling based on performance
- Built-in statistics and retention graphs
- Mobile sync for anywhere review
- Best for: Flashcard-based learning

**Spreadsheet Tracking:**
- Custom study log with formulas

**Note-Taking Apps (Notion, Obsidian):**
- Learning plan + notes in one place
- Link related concepts
- Progress tracking with checkboxes
- Best for: Integrated learning systems

### Analog Methods

**Bullet Journal Study Log:**
- Daily: Topics covered, time spent, retention feel (🟢🟡🔴)
- Weekly: Review summary, adjustments needed
- Monthly: Big picture progress, milestone tracking
- Best for: Tactile learners, low-tech preference

**Physical Flashcard Box (Leitner System):**
- Box 1: New cards (review daily)
- Box 2: Correct once (review every 3 days)
- Box 3: Correct twice (review weekly)
- Box 4: Correct 3x (review bi-weekly)
- Box 5: Mastered (review monthly)
- Move cards forward on success, back to Box 1 on failure

## Schedule Calculation

### Formula for Total Study Time

```
Total Hours = (Initial Learning Hours) + (Review Hours)

Initial Learning Hours = Σ (Unit Hours × 1.5 buffer)

Review Hours = Initial Learning Hours × 0.4
  (Reviews take ~40% as long as initial learning)

Example:
- 10 units × 5 hours each = 50 hours initial
- 50 hours × 1.5 buffer = 75 hours initial learning
- 75 hours × 0.4 = 30 hours review
- Total: 75 + 30 = 105 hours
```

### Converting to Daily Schedule

```
Daily Time Needed = Total Hours / (Available Days × Consistency Factor)

Consistency Factor = 0.7 (assume you'll miss ~30% of days due to life)

Example:
- 105 total hours
- 90 days available
- 90 days × 0.7 consistency = 63 actual study days
- 105 hours / 63 days = 1.67 hours/day needed
- Round up to 1.75 hours (105 min) daily commitment
```

### Review Load Over Time

```
Week 1: Mostly new material (80% new, 20% review)
Week 4: Balanced (50% new, 50% review)
Week 8+: Mostly reviews (20% new, 80% review)

Plan your schedule with this ramp-up in mind.
```

## Adjustment Rules

### When Retention is Too Low (<60%)

**Diagnoses:**
1. **Not understanding material initially**: Slow down, get help, read more sources
2. **Forgetting too quickly**: Shorten review intervals (try 1-2-4-8-16 day schedule)
3. **Poor retrieval practice**: Switch to more active methods (flashcards → practice problems)
4. **Interference**: Similar topics confusing each other (add contrastive examples)

### When Retention is Too High (>90%)

**Opportunity:**
- You're reviewing too often (wasting time)
- Extend intervals: 1-3-8-20-50 days instead of 1-3-7-14-30
- Reduce review time, add new material

### When Falling Behind Schedule

**Options:**
1. **Extend timeline**: Add 2-4 weeks to deadline if possible
2. **Drop low-priority units**: Focus on High and Medium priority only
3. **Increase daily time**: Add 15-30 min/day if sustainable
4. **Triage**: Master critical material, accept "good enough" on rest

### When Burning Out

**Warning Signs:**
- Dread opening study materials
- Can't focus for more than 5 minutes
- Skipping multiple days in a row
- Physical symptoms (headaches, fatigue, insomnia)

**Recovery:**
- Reduce daily time by 50% for 1 week
- Switch to easiest/most enjoyable material
- Add rewards after sessions (walk, snack, show episode)
- Reconnect with intrinsic motivation (why you're learning this)
- If severe: Take 3-7 day break entirely
